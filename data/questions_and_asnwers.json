"{\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_2977\": {\"Why are new rules needed?\": \"The internet has proven to be a great connector, including for children and especially throughout the pandemic. However, children may also be exposed to risks online, including when it comes to child sexual abuse. The past years have seen an overwhelming increase of sexual abuse online, both in sharing child sexual abuse material online, and in solicitation of children into sexually abusing themselves or even meeting perpetrators offline. According to Europol's analysis, in the first months of the COVID-19 crisis the demand for child sexual abuse material increased by up to 25% in some Member States. The US National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) also found that reports containing instances of child sexual abuse globally increased substantially, with NCMEC receiving almost 30 million reports of suspected child sexual exploitation in 2021, and with law enforcement being alerted to over 4000 new child victims. Reports of children subjected to grooming behaviour increased by more than 16% from 2020 to 2021. The circulation of pictures or videos picturing abuse among offenders re-victimises children and makes it difficult for them to find closure. Currently, certain online service providers detect online child sexual abuse on a voluntary basis. US service providers in fact supply the majority of reports that reach law enforcement, with NCMEC forwarding EU related reports to Europol and national law enforcement. While the measures taken by providers make an important contribution, they vary widely, with the vast majority of reports coming from a handful of providers, while a significant number take no action. Up to 95% of all reports of child sexual abuse received in 2020 came from one company, despite clear evidence that the problem does not only exist on one platform alone. Voluntary action is therefore insufficient to effectively address the misuse of online services for the purposes of child sexual abuse. A clear and binding legal framework is needed, with clear safeguards, to give providers legal certainty and ensure full respect for fundamental rights. Obliging service providers where necessary to detect, report and remove child sexual abuse will help rescue children from further abuse, prevent material from reappearing, and identify and prosecute offenders.\", \"What are the key elements of the proposal?\": \"The proposal provides a uniform approach to detecting and reporting child sexual abuse, supports the work of public authorities and seeks to boost EU efforts on prevention and assistance to victims. It will: Impose obligations on service providers to prevent child sexual abuse online by assessing and mitigating risks and, where needed, adopt targeted orders to detect, report and remove online child sexual abuse: The proposed rules introduce an obligation for relevant online service providers to assess the risk of their services' misuse for the dissemination of child sexual abuse materials or for the solicitation of children (\\u201cgrooming\\u201d). Member States will need to designate national authorities in charge of reviewing the risk assessment and the mitigating measures proposed by the service provider to prevent child sexual abuse online. Where such authorities determine that a significant risk remains, they can ask a court or an independent administrative authority to issue a detection order for known or new child sexual abuse material or grooming to address any remaining significant risk in a targeted manner. Detection orders are limited in time, subject to strict procedural safeguards, and target a specific type of offence on a specific service. The intervention of data protection authorities is strengthened, building on the General Data Protection Regulation.Introduce strong safeguards on detection: Companies having received a detection order will only be able to detect content using indicators to identify child sexual abuse, provided by the EU Centre, that have been created based on child sexual abuse online previously identified by relevant independent authorities or a court in the Member States. It is therefore not left to the provider to determine what is illegal in the EU. Detection technologies must only be used for the purpose of detecting child sexual abuse. Providers will have to deploy technologies that are the least privacy-intrusive in accordance with the state of the art in the industry, and that limit the error rate of false positives to the maximum extent possible.Create a new EU Agency to prevent and combat child sexual abuse: The EU Centre to prevent and combat child sexual abuse will maintain a database of indicators allowing the reliable identification of child sexual abuse materials and of solicitation of children as defined by EU rules. The EU Centre will also receive and process reports from providers of any child sexual abuse materials or solicitation of children detected on their services, and will share them with the competent law enforcement authorities and Europol, unless they are submitted in error. It will function as an important safeguard by preventing false positives from being reported to law enforcement, ensuring visibility on the effectiveness of detection measures, transparency and accountability of the process.\", \"Who will the new rules apply to?\": \"The proposed rules will apply to online service providers offering services in the EU, namely hosting services and interpersonal communication services (such as messaging services), app stores and internet access providers. The new obligations will be targeted to the types of service providers whose services are most misused for child sexual abuse online, and will first and foremost aim to create incentives for stronger child protection. These services have an important role to play in fighting child sexual abuse, as they are often the only ones to have any possibility to detect ongoing abuse. Frequently, abuse is only discoverable thanks to the efforts of online service providers to detect child sexual abuse material on their services, and protect children from being approached by offenders online. This is particularly the case in electronic (private individual or group) communications, which offenders frequently use to exchange material and approach children. The internet has also given offenders a new way of approaching children. They contact children on social media, gaming platforms and chats and lure them into producing compromising images of themselves or into offline meetings. In 2021, there was a three-fold increase in \\u201cself-generated\\u201d imagery showing 7-10 year olds, and NCMEC reported that online enticement is exponentially on the rise. Service providers are the first actors with the possibility to counter this crisis, taking into account the facilitation of global sharing of materials and the creation of specific networks of offenders who share resources and strategies to best target and solicit children. To facilitate enforcement, providers of hosting or interpersonal communication services not established in any EU Member State, but offering their services in the EU, will be required to designate a legal representative in the EU.\", \"What material is covered under the proposal?\": \"The detection obligations cover known material (re-uploaded photos and videos that have been previously identified as child sexual abuse material), new material (photos and videos not previously identified), and grooming (a practice where child sexual abuse offenders build a relationship of trust and emotional connection with children in order to manipulate and sexually exploit and abuse them). In line with the central objective of the proposal to better protect children, the identification of grooming only concerns interpersonal communications where it is known that one of the users is a child. This only occurs where the risk assessment has indicated a significant risk of misuse of the service for the purpose of online child sexual abuse, notwithstanding the mitigation measures taken by the provider.\", \"Does the proposal cover encrypted material?\": \"The proposed obligations on service providers as regards the detection of child sexual abuse material are technologically neutral, meaning they do not prescribe which technology should be used for detection. It is an obligation of result not of means, leaving to the provider the choice of technology to be operated, subject to its compliance with strict safeguards. This includes the use of encryption technology. Encryption is an important tool for the protection of cybersecurity and confidentiality of communications. At the same time, its use as a secure channel could be abused of by criminals to hide their actions, thereby impeding efforts to bring perpetrators of child sexual abuse to justice. A large portion of reports of child sexual abuse, which are instrumental to starting investigations and rescuing children, come from services that are already encrypted or may become encrypted in the future. If such services were to be exempt from requirements to protect children and to take action against the circulation of child sexual abuse images and videos via their services, the consequences would be severe for children. NCMEC estimates that more than half of its CyberTipline reports will vanish with end-to-end encryption, leaving abuse undetected, unless providers take measures to protect children and their privacy also on end-to-end encrypted services. Analyses show this would be an estimated loss of 2100 reports per day, reports that could have led to the rescue of children from ongoing abuse and the prevention of further abuses by offenders. The Commission works closely with industry, civil society organisations, and academia in the context of the EU Internet Forum, to support research that identifies technical solutions to scale up and feasibly and lawfully be implemented by companies to detect child sexual abuse in end-to-end encrypted electronic communications in full respect of fundamental rights. The proposed legislation takes into account recommendations made under a separate, ongoing multi-stakeholder process exclusively focused on encryption arising from the December 2020 Council Resolution. This work has shown that solutions exist, but have not been tested on a wide scale basis. The Commission will continue to work with all relevant stakeholders to address regulatory and operational challenges and opportunities in the fight against these crimes.\", \"What are the obligations of the service providers under these new rules?\": \"The new rules set out obligations to assess and mitigate risks, and, where necessary, to detect, report and remove child sexual abuse online, including known and new images and videos, as well as cases of grooming. Providers of hosting or interpersonal communication services will be obliged to conduct a risk assessment, in which they will evaluate the likelihood that the service could be used for the purpose of online child sexual abuse, and the mitigating measures they take to reduce any risk identified and hence to prevent child sexual abuse online on their services. Based on this assessment, where the risk remains significant despite mitigating measures, the relevant national authorities may issue a detection order. Companies will be obliged to use the indicators (hashes/AI classifiers) provided by the EU Centre in their detection efforts. Detection orders are issued when a service (or the part of the service where it is possible to perform detection separately) is likely to be used for the purpose of online child sexual abuse after taking into account the mitigation measures taken by the provider. Once the order is issued, companies will be obliged to detect child sexual abuse on their services. Reports of any child sexual abuse online that is detected are sent to the new EU Centre, which will check the material to eliminate erroneous reports, and if necessary forward it to law enforcement and Europol. App stores will be required to take measures to limit the risk of children downloading apps that may expose them to a high risk of grooming, in cooperation with the providers of those apps. Internet access providers will be obliged to disable access to images and videos that cannot be taken down, e.g. because they are hosted outside of the EU in non-cooperative jurisdictions.\", \"How will the proposal prevent mass surveillance?\": \"What service providers will be able to do under this legislation will be very tightly ringfenced both before and after a detection order is issued. Firstly, detection orders are limited to situations where preventive measures do not suffice to limit the risk. Secondly, the process for issuing a detection order is very thorough and designed to ensure the measures are limited to what is strictly necessary: The proposal is built in concentric circles, narrowing down the scope of application of any obligation to detect at each step. First, it only applies to two individually identified types of providers: hosting services and publicly available interpersonal communications services.Both services are required to carry out thorough risk assessments and take steps to mitigate any risks identified.National authorities check these against the criteria specified, which rise in strictness along with the degree of interference. Only where the authorities are of the opinion that there is evidence of a significant risk of misuse, and that the reasons for issuing the detection order outweigh negative consequences for the rights and legitimate interests of all parties affected, having regard in particular to the need to ensure a fair balance between the fundamental rights of those parties, would they announce their intent to consider a detection order.Before any order is issued, the provider is consulted. If the authorities still find there is a risk, the provider is asked to state how it would implement detection. Where this involves high-risk processing, or in every case relating to the detection of grooming, the provider must conduct a data protection impact assessment and consult the data protection authorities.Only if national authorities then confirm a third time that a significant risk persists, would they be able to request an order from another independent authority or court. The independent authority or court would again reassess the case in view of all opinions and expertise submitted, including that of the data protection authorities.This iterative, triple layered, process ensures the measures are limited to the greatest extent possible to ensure they are strictly necessary. Thirdly, once an order is issued, the legislation sets an obligation of results, not of means: companies must comply with the detection obligations but are free to choose the technology for the online exchanges that best fits its services. Whilst this includes encryption, the proposal contains a strong set of safeguards on the detection technologies used. When issuing detection orders, national authorities have to take into account the availability and suitability of relevant technologies. This means that the detection order will not be issued if the state of development of the technology is such that there is no available technology that would allow the provider to comply with the detection order. Detection is performed automatically and anonymously, through state of the art technologies that ensure the highest possible effectiveness and minimise the impact on the right to privacy of users. Detection can only be based on the set of indicators of online child sexual abuse kept by the EU Centre under the control of national law enforcement authorities (they are the ones who confirm that a certain item is child sexual abuse). Human review only intervenes when indicators point to online child sexual abuse in a specific image, video or bit of conversation (in case of solicitation). When human review occurs, it is first performed at the level of the Centre, so that obvious false positive are not transmitted to law enforcement. The Centre also provides feedback to the provider, to allow for improvement of the detection tools over time. Finally, the proposal specifies that both providers and users have a right to challenge any measure affecting them in Court. In addition to those conditions, the European Data Protection Board is consulted on all the technologies to be included on the EU Centre's list. The European Data Protection Board is also consulted on the ways in which such technologies should be best deployed to ensure compliance with applicable EU rules on the protection of personal data. All of this means that the scope for issuing detection orders and for carrying out detection is very narrow and limited to what is strictly necessary, whilst avoiding any abuse of detection powers.\", \"What safeguards will service providers need to take into account in their detection efforts?\": \"The proposed rules create a balanced and targeted system, limited to what is strictly necessary and proportionate to address the misuse of relevant information society services for online child sexual abuse. Following the risk assessment performed by online service providers, only some of them will have to verify whether child sexual abuse material is present on their services. The proposal requires that these providers deploy technologies that are the least privacy-intrusive in accordance with the state of the art in the industry, and that limit the error rate of false positives to the maximum extent possible. Detection systems are only to be used for the intended purpose of detecting and reporting child sexual abuse. The proposal provides for judicial redress, with both providers and users having a right to challenge any measure affecting them in Court. Users have a right of compensation for any damage that might result from processing under the proposal. The proposal also sets out strong oversight mechanisms. This include requirements regarding the independence and powers of the national authorities charged with issuing the orders and overseeing their execution. In addition, the EU Centre to prevent and combat child sexual abuse will assess reports of potential online child sexual abuse made by providers, helping to minimise the risk of erroneous detection and reporting. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) and the national data protection supervisors will play a role in assessing detection technology, to ensure constant monitoring of compliance in respect of privacy and personal data. Provisions are also made to ensure transparency, with service providers, national authorities and the EU Centre having to report every year on their activities under the proposed rules.\", \"How will detection work and is it reliable?\": \"Providers currently detecting child sexual abuse material on a voluntary basis typically use automated technology. Automated tools look for specific indicators of possible child sexual abuse, meaning they are designed to check whether specific content is likely to be child sexual abuse, but not what specific content is about. Technologies for detection of known child abuse material are typically based on hashing, which creates a unique digital fingerprint of a specific image. Technologies currently used for the detection of new child abuse material include classifiers and artificial intelligence (AI). A classifier is any algorithm that sorts data into labelled classes, or categories of information, through pattern recognition. Technologies for the detection of grooming in text-based communications make use of analysis of text technologies and/or analysis of metadata. Human review is already typically in place even for the most accurate technologies such as hashing. Among companies that currently voluntarily detect know child sexual abuse, the use of automatic detection is highly reliable and shows extremely low false positive rates. High error rates (e.g. incorrectly flagging as child sexual abuse content that it is not), would be detected quickly under the proposed rules by the EU Centre, which will ensure that no false positives reach law enforcement. Companies are immediately notified when their tools are producing erroneous notifications, and are obliged to take steps to fix it.\", \"Will service providers receive support to comply with these new obligations?\": \"The EU Centre will help companies fulfill their obligations. It will provide the indicators to detect child sexual abuse, which will give providers certainty on what content is illegal in the EU.  The Centre will make available for free the technology to detect and conduct the human review of all the reports. This will alleviate the burden on the providers, especially smaller ones. Finally the Centre will give feedback on the accuracy of reporting, helping providers improve their processes.\", \"Will service providers not complying with the obligations under the proposed rules be fined?\": \"Each case will need to be assessed by the national authorities responsible. Member States will need to set out rules on effective, proportionate, and dissuasive penalties. When imposing sanctions, national authorities are asked to take into account the gravity, recurrence and duration of the breach \\u2013 but also whether the breach was intentional or negligent, whether it was a first breach by the provider in question, as well as the size and financial strength of the provider and its willingness to cooperate with the authorities. Penalties should not exceed 6 % of the provider's annual income or global turnover of the last business year.\", \"What will be the role and powers of the EU Centre to prevent and counter child sexual abuse?\": \"The Centre will have three major roles: supporting efforts on prevention, improving assistance to victims, and supporting the detection, reporting and removal of child sexual abuse online. The Centre will act as a hub of expertise on prevention. This will include raising awareness among children and parents/guardians, as well as efforts aimed at people who fear they may offend against children. The Centre will also pool expertise and research as regards support available to survivors. It will support victims in removing the materials depicting their abuse from the internet. The Centre will also help providers implement their obligations as regards the detection, reporting and removal of child sexual abuse online. It will facilitate access to reliable detection technologies to providers and will maintain a database of child sexual abuse indicators (hashes, AI patterns/classifiers) that will reliably enable the detection of what is defined as child sexual abuse according to EU rules. It will share those indicators with companies, providing clear information on what is illegal in the EU, instead of leaving service providers to rely on US definitions. The proposal therefore creates a proactive system, bringing all relevant service providers together to take action, reversing the current reactive system in which EU law enforcement is dependent on US law and voluntary actions by companies. The Centre will receive the reports from providers, check them to avoid false positives and forward them to Europol as well as to national law enforcement authorities. As the recipient of reports of child sexual abuse online the Centre will have an insight into the effectiveness of detection measures and will be able to ensure the transparency and accountability of the process.\", \"When will the EU Centre to prevent and counter child sexual abuse be established?\": \"Depending on the timeline for the adoption and implementation of the proposed Regulation, the Centre should start its work in 2024-2026. The Centre will start operations with a focus on prevention and assistance to victims. It is expected to be fully operational by 2030 as preparation for the new detection, reporting and removal process, including the creation of the database of child sexual abuse indicators, should by then be complete.\", \"What is being done to prevent child sexual abuse from happening in the first place?\": \"Prevention is key to combating child sexual abuse. The existing EU rules on combating the sexual abuse of children (Directive 2011/93) require Member States to invest in prevention programmes for convicted offenders and people who fear they may offend, and to put in place prevention activities through education and awareness raising. To help Member States implement these obligations fully and strengthen prevention, the Commission is creating a network of prevention experts, as announced in the July 2020 Strategy for a more effective fight against child sexual abuse. The network will foster communication and exchange of best practices between researchers and practitioners. The Commission's Joint Research Centre, in cooperation with the experts who may become part of the prevention network, has published a report presenting classification criteria for prevention programmes across the EU. The EU is also working to improve the protection of children from sexual abuse globally by supporting and cooperating with the WeProtect Global Alliance; and by providing funding to projects on prevention though the Internal Security Fund.\", \"What are the links with the new Better Internet for Kids strategy?\": \"The Better Internet for Kids strategy will help implement EU child safety legislation, including strengthened provisions in the planned Digital Services Act and the proposed Regulation on preventing and combatting child sexual abuse and sexual exploitation. Under the Better Internet for Kids strategy, the EU co-funds safer internet helplines and hotlines, and will continue to assist the public, in particular children, when confronted with harmful and illegal content including child sexual abuse material. If granted the status of \\u2018trusted flaggers' under the conditions of the planned Digital Services Act, these helplines and hotlines will be able to contribute to a swifter assessment of and action upon notifications of illegal content online.\", \"How does this proposal relate to the Digital Services Act?\": \"The Digital Services Act will create a harmonised baseline for addressing all illegal content in general. Throughout the Digital Services Act, child sexual abuse material and illegal content in general will be addressed in a reactive manner, on a case-by-case basis. The proposed Regulation on preventing and combatting child sexual abuse and sexual exploitation will complement the general framework to be established under the Digital Services Act with specific and targeted rules to prevent and tackle the dissemination and circulation of known child sexual abuse material.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_2885\": {\"What is the debt-equity bias?\": \"Most countries, including in the European Union, treat debt more favourably than equity from a tax perspective. They do so by allowing interest payments to be deducted from their taxable income, while not offering the same allowance to equity. This gives businesses a major incentive to borrow, rather than to fund new investments by increasing capital.\", \"Why is the debt-equity bias a problem?\": \"The debt-equity bias can encourage companies to make their business decisions based on the related tax treatment, rather than on commercial considerations. This can lead to some companies choosing debt financing over equity, even if it is not the best option for them. Equity should receive similar tax treatment as debt, so that companies can consider both options on an equal footing and choose the source of financing that is best for their business-model.\", \"What are the advantages of tackling the debt-equity bias?\": \"Addressing the debt-equity bias could contribute to the re-equitisation of companies, making them stronger and more resilient to shocks. Equity is also particularly important for fast-growing innovative companies in their early stages and for companies that wish to expand globally. The green and digital transitions require new investments in innovative technologies. More than 50% of green investment in the coming years is estimated to come from new technologies, requiring more risk financing. Equity will therefore have an important role in fostering the sustainable transition towards a greener economy and in Europe's overall growth and economic stability.\", \"What is the European Commission proposing?\": \"The Commission's proposal will create a level playing field for debt and equity, from a tax perspective, thereby removing taxation as a factor which can influence companies' funding decisions. The proposal would make new equity tax deductible, just as debt currently is. A more favourable rate of deduction is proposed for SMEs, given that they have more difficulty in accessing equity markets than larger companies.\", \"How will this work in practice?\": \"The equity allowance would be computed based on the difference between net equity at the end of the current tax year and net equity at the end of the previous tax year, multiplied by a notional interest rate. This means that the allowance would be granted only for the sum of equity increases over a specific year. The notional interest rate is the 10-year risk-free interest rate for the relevant currency, and increased by a risk premium of 1% or, in the case of SMEs, a risk premium of 1,5%. The allowance on equity is deductible for 10 consecutive tax years, as long as it does not exceed 30% of the taxpayer's taxable income. Moreover, if the allowance on equity is higher than the taxpayer's net taxable income, the taxpayer may carry forward the excess of allowance on equity without a time limitation. Taxpayers will also be able to carry forward their unused allowance on equity which exceeds the 30% of taxable income, for a maximum of 5 tax years. Lastly, the proposal introduces a reduction of debt interest deductibility by 15%, so to better mitigate the debt-equity bias, not only from the equity side but also from the debt side.\", \"How does this fit into the wider Commission tax agenda?\": \"In May 2021, the Commission published its Communication on Business Taxation for the 21st Century, which sets out a long-term vision to provide a fair and sustainable business environment and EU tax system, as well as targeted measures to promote productive investment and entrepreneurship and ensure effective taxation. DEBRA was one of the actions proposed to help businesses left vulnerable by the COVID crisis, preventing insolvencies and instability. The proposal also contributes to the EU's Capital Markets Union Action Plan (CMU), which aims at helping companies raise the capital they need, particularly as they navigate the post-pandemic period. The CMU incentivises long-term investments to foster the sustainable and digital transition of the EU economy.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_2826\": {\"  Why are you coming forward with a new European strategy for a Better Internet for Kids (BIK+)?\": \"Since the adoption of the first \\u201cEuropean Strategy for a Better Internet for Children (BIK) in 2012, digital technologies and the way children use them have changed dramatically. Modern devices allow children to easily interact, contact and share information with others, often without parental supervision. Most children use their smartphones daily and almost twice as much compared to 2012, as well as from a much younger age (EU Kids online 2020). Digital technologies offer children unprecedented prospects for online education, entertainment, social contact and active participation in society, but this is not without risks, such as exposure to disinformation or harmful and illegal online content. The pandemic further highlighted that not all children have equal and safe access to digital technologies. Also, age verification mechanisms and parental consent tools are still in many cases ineffective, meaning harmful and illegal content can be in easy reach for children. These are just a few examples of how the digital world has transformed, and why an updated strategy for a Better Internet for Kids is needed.\", \"  How is the new strategy different from the 2012 one?\": \"A flagship initiative in the European Year of Youth, the new European strategy for a Better Internet for Kids (BIK+) will balance protection, for example against age-inappropriate and illegal content, and empowerment with digital skills, as well as foster child participation on digital matters. Since 2012, EU's legal and policy framework for child online safety has also significantly evolved. The new Strategy will support implementation of EU legislation on child safety, including the Audio-visual Media Services Directive (AVMSD), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the strengthened provisions on child online safety in the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the newly adopted proposal for new EU legislation to protect children against sexual abuse. In particular, the new strategy for a Better Internet for Kids will help implement these EU laws through a comprehensive EU code of conduct on age-appropriate design. The code will aim to address for instance the lack of effective age verification, the gathering of personal data and the commercial manipulation of children as well as the need for child-appropriate communication. The strategy will promote media and digital literacy activities, also for teachers and parents. Specific attention will be paid to vulnerable children, as children can be in diverse and challenging situations, while at the same time many of them do not yet have sufficient access to digital technologies. Peer-to-peer activities are also encouraged, leveraging on the good work of the BIK Youth Ambassadors, a group of young people developing youth participation activities.\", \"  What does the Commission want to achieve with the new European strategy for a Better Internet for Kids?\": \"Every child in Europe deserves to thrive in a safe digital environment and enjoy their digital rights in full, irrespective of their geographical, economical or personal background. Online content and services should be accessible, age-appropriate and informative, and created in respect of children's best interests. The vision of the strategy is for all European children to be protected, empowered and respected online, with no one left behind.\", \"  How will the Strategy for a Better Internet for Kids work in practice?\": \"In the new strategy, the Commission is committed to specific actions and invites the Member States and industry to join in and take action as well. The new strategy for a Better Internet for Kids will build on the achievements of the former (2012) strategy, and continue to co-finance the network of Safer Internet Centres in Member States, which together with the EU-funded betterinternetforkids.eu portal will be the backbone for its implementation. The centres will organise at national and local level media literacy actions, create awareness about risks for children, as consumers of digital products and services, involve children and young people through youth panels and youth ambassadors to share their views on the digital world, promote peer-to-peer training and offer swift reporting of harmful and illegal content via helplines and hotlines. The Safer Internet Centres in the Member States will also help further children in vulnerable situations to address the digital divide. In addition, the Commission will continue to coordinate the Member State Expert Group to exchange best practices, and facilitate dialogue between industry, civil society and children, through the Alliance to better protect children online to which around 40 major ICT/media companies belong.\", \"  What are the links with the proposal for new EU legislation to protect children against sexual abuse?\": \"The new European strategy for a Better Internet for Kids and the proposal for new EU legislation to protect children against sexual abuse are part of a comprehensive package on child online protection and empowerment. Under the strategy, the Commission will continue to fund the EU network of hotlines to which the public can report anonymously potential child sexual abuse material  encountered online. The reporting of illegal, including child sexual abuse material, and harmful content, will also be supported by Safer Internet Centres' helplines and hotlines. The proposal for new EU legislation to protect children against sexual abuse aims to define the responsibilities of providers, obliging them to assess and mitigate the risk of misuse of their services; and where necessary, to detect and report online child sexual abuse and remove child sexual abuse material. A new EU Centre will facilitate the efforts of service providers and act as a hub of expertise on prevention and on supporting victims.\", \"  What are the benefits for children and for their digital rights?\": \"Children's rights are human rights and form part of the founding principles of the European Union. They must be respected online as offline as acknowledged by the General Comment 25 on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in relation to the digital environment, adopted by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in 2021. The EU and all Member States have signed this UN Convention. The European Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles for the Digital Decade will guide the digital transformation in the EU. Digital rights include not only the right to be protected online but also the right to be empowered with new skills, opportunities and active participation in society. The right to be respected, to freedom of expression, right to privacy, right to education, leisure and play, right to information, they all apply online as offline.\", \"  What is the link with the Rights of the Child strategy?\": \"In March 2021, the Commission adopted its first comprehensive strategy on the Rights of the Child (\\u2018RoC Strategy'). This strategy calls for an EU where children can navigate the digital environment and harness its opportunities, without being harmed or placed at risk. The majority (63%) of respondents to the open consultation on the Rights of the Child Strategy acknowledged the need for a new strategy for a Better Internet for Kids. As the digital arm of the Rights of the Child strategy, the new strategy for a Better Internet for Kids replies to this call.\", \"  How will children be involved in the new strategy?\": \"Children and young people have been part of the new strategy from the very beginning. For instance, around 70 consultations with over 750 children and young people were organised all over Europe in spring and summer 2021. The strategy proposes several actions where children will play an active role. The EU wants to involve children in the creation of the EU code of conduct on age-appropriate design by 2024; to set up a child-led initiative for promoting digital citizenship through the EU Children's Participation Platform; and to support peer-to-peer training to promote online opportunities and tackle risks through the Safer Internet Centres. Under the new strategy, BIK Youth Ambassadors - young people working together with the Commission to implement the strategy - will continue to inform and advise the Commission, industry and other partners in events and activities. In addition, a child-led evaluation of the new strategy will be organised every two years.\", \"   How does the strategy address the digital divide?\": \"To benefit from digital opportunities, children need a reliable internet connection, affordable data, suitable digital devices, and digital skills. The connectivity targets of the Digital Compass Communication - a vision for a successful digital transformation of Europe by 2030, the Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles and significant EU investment and funding, all address connectivity for homes and schools. The European Child Guarantee recommends Member States to \\u2018provide [...] adequate equipment necessary for distance learning' [and] \\u2018make the necessary investment to tackle all forms of digital divide'. Children with special or specific needs or from disadvantaged and vulnerable backgrounds need special attention. Digital deprivation in childhood can reinforce the digital divide in adult life. The new strategy will contribute by strengthening the support offered to children in vulnerable situations by the Safer Internet Centres in Member States, particularly through teaching safety skills.  Media literacy campaigns targeting children, teachers and parents will also be organised.\", \"Will the measures be legally binding for Member States?\": \"The strategy is not legally binding but it invites Member States to be actively involved and to take certain actions. It supports implementation of EU legislation and therefore can be a useful tool for Member States. It also facilitates and supports the exchange of good practices among Member States, for example on digital literacy and child participation by giving them a say in the digital environment.\", \"What will be the role of industry?\": \"Industry has a key responsibility and role to play in ensuring safe and age-appropriate digital experiences and services for children and young people. The Commission will invite industry to participate in a comprehensive EU code of conduct on age-appropriate design by 2024, a co-regulatory initiative under the Digital Services Act, involving policymakers, civil society and children. The code will address in an agile way a broad range of risks to children, providing good practices and guidance to industry to fulfil the obligations set by EU law. It will aim to address, for instance, the lack of effective age verification, the gathering of personal data and the commercial manipulation of children, the need of child-appropriate communication, and safety by design and by default. As this code will help clarify expectations for industry, the Commission will encourage companies to participate in its development and sign it by 2024. Once signed, the companies will have certain obligations to meet and their progress will be regularly monitored and evaluated. In addition, the Commission invites industry to actively involve children when developing and deploying digital products and services.\", \"How will the new strategy address age verification?\": \"Easy access to inappropriate content (e.g. on self-harm, pornography, eating disorders, risky online challenges) is one of the main concerns identified by both children and parents contacting the EU network of Safer Internet Centres and consulted for the new Strategy. EU laws - in particular the Audio-visual Media Services Directive (AVMSD) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - are in place and technical solutions to verify age exist. Nevertheless, in practice age-verification mechanisms are mostly ineffective, and users often only need to enter any birth date or tick a box to register. Under the strategy for a Better Internet for Kids, the Commission will work towards a European standard on age verification. This type of standard will clarify what is expected from industry when age verification is required on any online tools and services. Such recognised methods would be used by pornography websites, for example, to ensure their users are aged 18 or over. In parallel, Commission will explore how to use the planned European Digital Identity wallet for age verification. The Commission will work with Member States and encourage them to issue electronic IDs to minors under the age of 18, to strengthen effective age verification methods. This would lead to an EU-wide recognised \\u2018under / over age X' proof of age based on date of birth in a privacy-preserving and secure manner.\", \"Does the Strategy apply outside of the EU?\": \"This is a European strategy, but joining forces with international partners allows us to address harmful and illegal content effectively and efficiently, as these global digital issues know no border. The Commission will continue to share experiences, expertise and values with relevant international organisations and partners, and to support a common approach towards digital safety for children worldwide, for example encouraging relevant technical standards, metrics, definitions and approaches, and  continue to protect and promote child rights online everywhere, fulfilling the rights of all children. The impact of the 2012 \\u2018European Strategy for a Better Internet for Children' has already gone beyond the borders of Europe and for instance the annual Safer Internet Day \\u2013 originally an EU action \\u2013 is now celebrated worldwide, and the annual conference Safer Internet Forum welcomes participants from outside Europe. This will continue under the new strategy for a Better Internet for Kids.\", \"What concrete actions are expected in the medium term?\": \"Under the Digital Europe Programme, the EU will continue to co-fund the network of Safer Internet Centres in Member States and the betterinternetforkids.eu platform, which is the pan-European hub for child online safety with resources and material in all EU languages. The Commission is also committed to initiate, or continue, a range of actions in 2022, which marks the European Year of Youth: Organise media literacy campaigns targeting children, teachers and parents mobilising multipliers.Facilitate the exchange of good practices for national curricula on media literacy between Member States and amongst schools and educators across the EU.Strengthen the support offered to children in vulnerable situations by the Safer Internet Centres in Member States to address the digital divide.Develop awareness raising tools and activities for children as young consumers with the support of the Safer Internet Centres and the betterinternetforkids.eu platform.Expand the role of BIK Youth Ambassadors and BIK Youth Panels - young people working with the Commission to implement the strategy - to support peer-to-peer activities at national and local level.Start mapping the existing research on the neurologic impact on children of methods used for commercial purposes. The Commission also commits to: Encourage and facilitate the design of a comprehensive EU code of conduct on age-appropriate design under the Digital Services Act, by 2024;Issue a standardisation request for a European standard on age assurance / age verification compatible with the proposal for a European Digital Identity Regulation (eID proposal), by 2024;Support the development of an EU-wide recognised proof of age based on date of birth within the eID initiative;Ensure the single harmonised number \\u2018116 111' offers assistance to victims on cyberbullying, in cooperation with the EU co-funded Safer Internet Centre helplines, by 2023.\", \"How will the Commission monitor implementation and progress in Member States?\": \"Similarly to the 2012 European Strategy for a Better Internet for Children, the progress in Member States will be monitored through the \\u2018BIK map tool', which collects, compares and exchanges information on the implementation of the strategy for a Better Internet for Kids in the Member States. The new strategy will be monitored every two years and a report will be published online.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_2811\": {\"How did the Commission assess Croatia's first payment request?\": \"On 15 March 2022, Croatia submitted to the Commission a request for the disbursement of \\u20ac700 million under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). The request was based on the achievement of the 33 milestones and one target for the first instalment, as outlined in the Council Implementing Decision approving the plan. They cover reforms in the areas of health, social policy, adult education, anti-corruption, audit and control, anti-money laundering, energy, transport, water and waste management as well as energy efficiency of buildings. The Commission carried out its preliminary assessment of the request within the two months period foreseen by the RRF Regulation. With their request, the Croatian authorities provided detailed and comprehensive evidence demonstrating the fulfilment of the 33 milestones and one target. The Commission has thoroughly assessed this information before endorsing the positive preliminary assessment of the payment request.\", \"What are the next steps?\": \"The Commission has now sent the positive preliminary assessment of Croatia's fulfilment of the milestones and targets required for this payment to the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC), asking for its opinion. The EFC's opinion, to be delivered within maximum four weeks, should be taken into account in the Commission's assessment. The Commission will adopt the decision on the disbursement of the financial contribution, in accordance with the examination procedure, through a comitology committee. Following the adoption of this decision by the Commission, the disbursement to Croatia would take place. The amounts disbursed to the Member States will be published in the Recovery and Resilience Scoreboard. The Commission has also shared its positive preliminary assessment with the European Parliament.\", \"How do the milestones and targets achieved by Croatia so far effectively support the green transition?\": \"The green transition is supported by specific reforms carried out by Croatia, such as the new Waste Act to improve waste management in the country as well as the adoption of energy renovation programmes for multi-apartment and cultural heritage buildings, and buildings in the areas of special state concern, which also aims to combat energy poverty. Croatia also prepared a detailed investment plan for water and wastewater investments to ensure the prioritisation of mature and urgent projects, as well as to ensure coherence with other funding sources. Croatia developed a framework for the design and implementation of green urban renewal strategies and set up the one-stop shop for energy renovation and seismic reinforcement in order to reduce the administrative burden for citizens. The Energy Efficiency Programme for decarbonising the energy sector has defined areas of investment in energy efficiency and district heating systems, including investment priorities until 2030, but also up to 2050. In addition, Croatia awarded 75 contracts to companies to support their transition to renewable energy sources and issued energy efficiency measures to support small, medium-sized and large businesses. Finally, Croatia established a legislative framework for the deployment of alternative fuels, which will encourage the production and use of advanced biofuels/hydrogen in transport and contribute to the increase of renewable energy in final energy consumption in the transport sector in the country and to the objectives of the green transition.\", \"How do the milestones and targets achieved by Croatia so far effectively contribute to the digital transition?\": \"While milestones and targets related to the digital transition are more concentrated in subsequent payment periods, one flagship milestone is already included in the first payment. It relates to the set-up of a unit for implementation and management of digital transformation projects in the Ministry of agriculture. The established unit, in cooperation with the relevant authorities, will plan and monitor a set of digital services in the agricultural sector, including: at least 30 digitalised public services, an operational smart Agriculture platform and a publicly accessible traceability information system. These investments will be presented in the forthcoming payment requests. The Smart Agriculture platform will set the basis for an efficient, profitable and sustainable Croatian agriculture sector by offering up-to-date, structured and timely information directly from the fields and farms, with appropriate expert support. The planned traceability information system is meant to monitor the traceability of agricultural and food products and better inform the consumer via a QR code.\", \"How do the milestones and targets achieved by Croatia so far contribute to improving Croatia's economic and social situation, and its resilience?\": \"The milestones in the first payment request contain reforms to improve the anti-money laundering framework, the fiscal framework and the governance of state-owned businesses, all of which are important for the efficient functioning of the economy. Croatia also successfully implemented the milestones related to education, employment and social services. A revised adult learning legal framework increases the quality and relevance of adult education and facilitates the recognition of acquired knowledge and skills. The revised Minimum Wage Act, among other things, strengthens the minimum increases for overtime, night work, and work on Sundays and public holidays as well as controls and penalties for employers not complying with the new rules. The National Plan against Poverty and Social Exclusion 2021-2027 identifies priorities and needs for the fight against poverty and social exclusion. Priorities for the development of social services and the outline of needs of all user groups for different forms of care was comprehensively addressed in the National Plan for the Development of Social Services 2021-2027. The resilience of the health system will also be improved by the adoption of the National Health Development Plan 2021-2027, which aims at improving the health system and health outcomes.\", \"Does the achievement of these first milestones and targets contribute to an effective implementation of the Plan?\": \"The milestones and targets fulfilled constitute significant steps in the implementation of the Croatian recovery and resilience plan, and of its broader transformative reform agenda. They include important measures, such as measures to strengthen the capacity to design and implement public policies and projects. These measures will contribute to a better absorption capacity of the EU funds in Croatia. In the area of governance of public finances and justice system, the adopted reforms will strengthen the fiscal and the anti-money laundering frameworks, improve the management of state assets and enhance the anti-corruption system with a new framework. Updated legislation on preventing conflicts of interest is also included. Croatia also supported small, medium, and large businesses in their effort to switch to renewable energy sources by setting up a framework for increasing their energy efficiency and by taking measures to improve water and waste management. Croatia also took measures to strengthen the labour market and enhance social protection. Finally, Croatia upgraded its audit and control and relevant IT systems and validated its control and audit procedures concerning the organisation and treatment of data under the RRF.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_2863\": {\"What are the results of the Conference on the Future of Europe?\": \"The results of the Conference are presented in the report on the outcome of the Conference, handed over to the Presidents of the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission on 9 May 2022. The centrepiece is the 49 proposals for the future of Europe set out in that report, covering nine topics: climate change and the environment; health; a stronger economy, social justice and jobs; EU in the world; values and rights, rule of law, security, digital transformation, European democracy, migration, education, culture, youth and sport. These proposals include general objectives and more than 300 concrete measures for the institutions to follow up on. Besides these proposals, the report includes a factual overview of the architecture of the Conference, focusing on its citizen-driven and innovative dimension, an overview of the Conference Plenary, as well as the recommendations of citizens' panels and references to national events and the report on the Multilingual Digital Platform.\", \"How was the consensus reached on the results of the Conference?\": \"The 49 proposals were formulated by the Conference Plenary on a consensual basis and then put forward to the Executive Board. At the Plenary meeting on 29 and 30 April 2022, representatives of the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, representatives from national parliaments reached a consensus on the final proposals of the Conference plenary and approved and the process that led to them.  The 108 members of the citizens' component expressed their final say on the basis of this consensus. At its meeting on 6 May 2022, the Executive Board drew up the Conclusions of the Plenary and endorsed by consensus the report on the outcome of the Conference.\", \"Why and when was the Conference launched?\": \"The Conference was launched to allow, by way of a citizens-focused, bottom-up, grass roots exercise, all Europeans to have a say on what they expect from the European Union and have a greater role in shaping the future of the Union. The signing of the Joint Declaration on the Conference on the Future of Europe on 10 March 2021 by the Presidents of the three EU institutions paved the way for this unprecedented, open and inclusive European democratic exercise, which places citizens at its very heart. On 19 April 2021, the Multilingual Digital Platform of the Conference was launched, and on 9 May 2021, an inaugural event of the Conference took place in the European Parliament's premises in Strasbourg.\", \"Who participated in the Conference and what were its main elements?\": \"The Multilingual Digital Platform was set up as the main hub of the Conference. It gave everyone the chance to participate, by putting forward and debating ideas, as well as participating in events across Europe and reporting on their outcomes.A central and particularly innovative feature of the Conference was the European Citizens' Panels. A total of some 800 randomly selected citizens, representative of the EU's sociological and geographical diversity, organised into four Panels of 200 citizens, met for three deliberative sessions each and made recommendations. A third of each Panel is composed of young people (age 16 \\u2013 25).Member States organised National Citizens' Panels based on the same principles. In addition, they contributed to the Conference through a wide range of events and initiatives.A Conference Plenary was set up to debate the recommendations from the National and European Citizens' Panels, and the input gathered from the Multilingual Digital Platform, grouped by themes. Together with citizens representing European Citizens' Panels and national panels/events, it gathered representatives of EU institutions and advisory bodies, elected representatives at national, regional and local level, and representatives of social partners and civil society.An Executive Board oversaw the organisation of the Conference.\", \"What was the input of the Multilingual Digital Platform to the results of the Conference?\": \"The Multilingual Digital Platform allowed to gather ideas from participants on the platform, as well as input from the multitude of original and innovative events taking place under the umbrella of the Conference in the Member States. By May 2022, close to 5 million individual visitors had visited the Multilingual Digital Platform and there were over 50,000 active participants, 18,000 ideas debated, and over 6,500 events registered on the Platform. Throughout the Conference, reports were drawn up on the contributions submitted on the Platform. The reports, including the thematic mind maps, provided valuable input to the work of the European Citizens' Panels. Many ideas on the Platform are therefore reflected in the recommendations of the European Citizens' Panels. Contributions gathered through the Platform were also debated and discussed in the Conference Plenary and its Working Groups.\", \"What was the input of the European Citizens Panels and national panels to the final results of the Conference?\": \"Each of the four European Citizens' Panels covered different topics in their work, focusing on (1) Stronger economy, social justice, jobs/education, youth, culture, sport/digital transformation; (2) European democracy/values and rights, rule of law, security; (3) Climate change, environment/health; and (4) EU in the world/migration. Each panel came up with a set of recommendations, and selected 20 ambassadors to the Conference Plenary to present and debate these recommendations. In addition, six Member States \\u2013 Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Lithuania and the Netherlands \\u2013 organised National Citizens' Panels under the same principles as European Citizens' Panels. Altogether, the four European Citizens' Panels and six National Panels adopted 178 recommendations, which were the main basis for the proposals prepared in the Conference Plenary and Working Groups.\", \"What was the role of the Conference Plenary?\": \"The Conference Plenary met seven times from June 2021 to April 2022. It ensured that the recommendations from the National and European Citizens' Panels, and input gathered from the Multilingual Digital Platform, were debated and turned into proposals. After the recommendations were presented by and discussed with citizens, the Plenary put forward its proposals on a consensual basis to the Executive Board. Nine Plenary Working Groups were also established, to prepare the debates and the proposals of the Conference Plenary. The Working Groups held lively and constructive debates in their meetings ahead of the Conference Plenaries, as well as online. At the 7th Conference Plenary, 49 proposals of the Plenary, covering nine topics, were on a consensual basis put forward to the Executive Board.\", \"What was the impact of the Russian aggression against Ukraine on the Conference?\": \"The geopolitical developments during the Conference, and especially the Russian invasion of Ukraine, gave a new perspective to the Conference process. They underlined the importance of upholding democratic values in EU Member States and in the world, while continuing to engage with citizens and nurturing the democratic legitimacy of the EU, which is a peace project in its origin. Ukrainian citizens and Members of the Parliament were heard during the Plenary and invited to the closing event of the Conference. Several citizens' recommendations became more prominent in the light of these developments and Plenary discussions frequently considered the proposals in the new geopolitical context.\", \"How will the results of the Conference be followed up and how will the participants be informed about it?\": \"The Conference allowed the EU institutions to listen carefully to the concerns, ambitions, and ideas expressed by citizens across Europe. The next step in this process is to come up with concrete EU action building on the outcome of the Conference, contained in the final report. The EU institutions will now examine swiftly how to follow up effectively on this report, each within their own sphere of competences and in accordance with the Treaties. A feedback event will take place to update citizens in autumn 2022.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_2712\": {\"What is the EHDS proposal about?\": \"Every second, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, researchers and health regulators all over the EU generate and use large numbers of essential healthcare data that are critical to their lifesaving work. Health data are the blood running through the veins of our healthcare systems. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that up-to-date health data are key to take well informed public health measures and to respond to crises. The pandemic has also triggered a huge acceleration in the uptake of digital tools. Unfortunately, there are still complex obstacles that make it difficult to reach the full potential of digital health and health data. The European Health Data Space will overcome these obstacles. It is a health-specific data sharing framework establishing clear rules, common standards and practices, infrastructures and a governance framework for the use of electronic health data by patients and for research, innovation, policy making, patient safety, statistics or regulatory purposes.\", \"Who benefits from the EHDS?\": \"The European Health Data Space will empower individuals across the EU to fully exercise their rights over their health data. People will be able to easily access and share these data, while retaining greater control over them, fully in line with our overall EU approach to data protection. At the same time, the work of health professionals' will be made easier and more effective. With improved interoperability, health professionals will be able to access a patient's medical history across borders, thus increasing the evidence base for decisions on treatment and diagnosis, including when the patients' data is in another EU country. By strengthening interoperability to support data exchange between healthcare providers within countries and across borders, healthcare providers will avoid duplications of tests, with positive effects for patients and healthcare costs. Researchers will also benefit from a more direct way of obtaining access to data within a trusted and secure framework. Researchers will have access to larger amounts of high-quality data. They will be able to access the data in a more efficient and less expensive way, through a data access body that guarantees the privacy of the patients. Regulators and policymakers will also have easier access to health data for policy making and for a better functioning of healthcare systems. This will lead to better access to healthcare, reduced costs, increased efficiency, more resilient health systems, new research and innovation and enable more evidence-based policymaking. Industry will benefit from an EU-wide market for electronic health record systems, with the same standards and specifications. Greater availability of electronic health data will improve people's health, facilitate the production of innovative medicinal products and devices that offer better and more personalised care. Industry will be also able to develop new devices that use artificial intelligence technology.\", \"What kind of governance system will be introduced?\": \"The EHDS will reinforce governance at national and EU level. It builds upon the current cooperation for the primary use of data in healthcare (the use of data for the patients themselves) within the eHealth Network, which showed its value during the COVID-19 pandemic. The EHDS extends the scope of this primary use and will now also regulate secondary use of health data (the re-use of aggregated health data by for example researchers, policy makers, innovators and industry). The EHDS rules on the re-use of health data build on the framework introduced by the Data Governance Act. A new European Health Data Space Board will be created, composed of the representatives of digital health authorities and new health data access bodies from all the Member States, the Commission and observers. It will contribute to a consistent application of the rules throughout the EU, including by advising the European Commission, while cooperating with other EU bodies and stakeholders such as patient organisations. Member States will also cooperate at EU level on two cross-border digital infrastructures to enable data sharing (one for primary uses of health data and another one for secondary uses of health data).\", \"What are the benefits and costs of the EHDS and how will it be financed?\": \"Overall, the EHDS it is expected to save for the EU around \\u20ac11 billion over ten years: \\u20ac5.5 billion will be saved from better access and exchange of health data in healthcare and another \\u20ac5.4 billion will be saved from better use of health data for research, innovation and policy making. To make the EHDS a reality, further digitalisation is needed at national level. At the same time, it is necessary to set up interoperable EU-wide infrastructures to enable the cross-border use of health data in the EU. Both the Member States and the Commission will therefore support the EHDS under different EU funds and instruments. For instance, Member States have budgeted \\u20ac12 billion for investments in digital health under the Recovery and Resilience Facility. The European Regional Development Fund and Invest EU offer further opportunities for investment. In addition, the Commission will provide over \\u20ac810 million to support the EHDS. \\u20ac280 million will be available under the EU4Health Programme and the rest will be financed by the Digital Europe Programme, the Connecting Europe Facility and Horizon Europe.\", \"What is the expected impact on other initiatives of the European Health Union \\u2013 cancer, pharma, HERA?\": \"The EHDS is a central component of a strong European Health Union. It will help to boost the work under Europe's Beating Cancer Plan. Pooling and sharing knowledge, experience and data helps developing practical solutions for cancer patients. The EHDS will also enable the development of innovative approaches to cancer registration, allowing for more timely and efficient collection of information on various types of cancers. This will help to provide a real-time state of play of cancers across the EU. The EHDS will also allow health data to make a vital contribution to innovation, research and the development of new medicines, treatments, and medicinal products. As a result, it will strongly support the Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe and the work of HERA.\", \"What's in it for me?\": \"The Health Data Space, together with GDPR rights, will give you greater control over your health data. You will in particular: have access to your health data in electronic form immediately and without any cost be able to share your data with health professionals within the EU and across bordersbe able to add information, rectify errors, restrict access and obtain information on what health professional accessed your datahave certain categories of health data, such as patient summaries, ePrescriptions, images and image reports, laboratory results and discharge reports be issued and accepted in a European electronic health record exchange format. Moreover, your security and privacy will be ensured: researchers, industry or public institutions will have access to your health data only for specific purposes that benefit individuals and societybut they can only access data that do not reveal your identitythe data can only be accessed and processed in closed, secure environments and only anonymised data can be downloaded.\", \"Can you give concrete examples of how the EHDS will function?\": \"Example 1: A woman living in Portugal is going on holidays to France. Unfortunately, she gets sick in France and therefore needs to see a local general practitioner. Thanks to the EHDS and MyHealth@EU, a doctor in France will see on his/her computer the medical history of this patient in French. The doctor can prescribe the necessary medicine based on the medical history of the patient, avoiding for instance products to which the patient is allergic. Example 2: A health tech company is developing a new AI-based medical decision support tool that assists doctors to make diagnostic and treatment decisions following a review of the patient's laboratory images. The AI compares the patient's images with those of many other previous patients. Through the EHDS, the company is able to have efficient and secure access to a large number of medical images to train the AI algorithm and optimise its accuracy and effectiveness before seeking market approval. Example 3: A man has a medical image of his lungs, taken in the public hospital where he was brought in by the emergency team. Shortly after, he visits his regular pulmonologist in another hospital. Thanks to the EHDS, his pulmonologist can see the medical image performed in the other hospital, thus avoiding a new, unnecessary test.\", \"What impact will the EHDS have on health professionals?\": \"Electronic health data will become available more easily for health professionals both within and across borders. With this improved interoperability, health professionals can access a patient's medical history, thus increasing the evidence base for decisions on treatment and diagnosis. Through easier and faster access to relevant health data, health professionals will be able to improve the continuity of care. They will also be able to access health data from different sources more easily, reducing the administrative burden from having to manually copy records across different systems. This will also positively impact healthcare system efficiencies. If health professionals are involved in research, they will enjoy the benefits of easier access to health data for research and innovation.\", \"How will the EHDS protect data privacy and security?\": \"The EHDS builds on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), proposed Data Governance Act, draft Data Act and NIS Directive. The EHDS complements these initiatives and provides more tailor-made rules for the health sector where needed. Trust is an important element of the EHDS. The proposal introduces security criteria for interoperability and security of electronic health record systems and requires manufacturers to certify them. The EHDS also builds on the possibility offered by GDPR to put forward an EU law supporting the use of health data for diagnosis and treatment and for research, statistics or for public interest. Moreover, processing electronic health data for secondary use of data is only possible for specific purposes foreseen in the Regulation, based on a permit issued by a data access body. It will be forbidden to use the data to take decisions detrimental to individuals, or to market health products towards health professionals or patients. Data processing can only take place in secure processing environments, which need to comply with very high standards of privacy and (cyber)-security and no personal data can be downloaded from such environments. Moreover, the researcher, company or public institution can only access non-identifiable data (offering information about the disease, symptoms and medication, without revealing the identity of the individual). It is forbidden for the user to re-identify the data subjects. Strict measures are paramount given the sensitive nature of health data.\", \"To what extent are Member States ready for the EHDS?\": \"Member States have different maturity levels when it comes to digital health. As regards primary use of health data: the use of health data for health service provision, as illustrated in different studies, some Member States have achieved high levels of digitalisation and interoperability within their borders, while others are in the process of taking the necessary steps. Patient summaries and e-prescription services exist in two-thirds of all Member States and are most frequently accessed via an online portal, but only in a few countries can they be sent or received across borders and 11 countries are still using paper printouts for prescriptions. Today, only ten Member States support the sharing of patient summaries and ePrescriptions via MyHealth@EU. There are however plans for all Member States to join MyHealth@EU by 2025. As regards the secondary use of health data for research, innovation, policy making and regulatory purposes: studies which inform regulatory decisions are currently often performed in a small set of databases clustered in a few EU Member States, limiting their geographical and demographic sample sizes. To overcome this fragmentation and the over-reliance on consent, some Member States started to adopt national laws. For instance, 13 Member States have started to put forward more centralised national systems to provide access to data, but there is no link between them at EU level, the system remains fragmented and there are differences between tasks, even though they share many commonalities. Some Member States have created Health Data Access Bodies such as Findata, French Data Hub, German Forschungsdatenzentren, and others. The EHDS is ambitious in the sense that the proposal wants to advance digital health for all Member States and to make the healthcare systems of the EU ready for the digital future.\", \"Will the EHDS share health data with industry?\": \"It is important that industry can use health data, to allow for innovation that will improve the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic showed again the importance of such innovation to develop vaccines that helped saving millions of lives. That is why industry will have the opportunity to make use of the health data access bodies, after they have been granted a permit for access to data. Only the data necessary for that specific research would be put at their disposal, without revealing individual's identity, and it can only be accessible in the secure processing environment for the duration of their project. In the context of healthcare, the EHDS only supports the access of health professionals to the data of their patients. Industry will not have access to such data.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_2745\": {\"What are the outermost regions?\": \"The EU counts with nine outermost regions: French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, Reunion Island and Saint-Martin (France), Azores and Madeira (Portugal), and the Canary Islands (Spain). The outermost regions are islands, archipelagos and one land territory (French Guiana). They are located in the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean basin, South America and the Indian Ocean and are home to 5 million EU citizens.\", \"What are the assets of the outermost regions for the EU?\": \"The outermost regions offer major assets to the EU: many of them have a young population, extensive maritime economic zones, unique biodiversity, rich renewable energy sources, location and climate suitable for space sciences and astrophysics activities, important space infrastructure and proximity to other continents. In addition, these regions are outposts of the EU with the untapped potential to reach out to surrounding countries and territories. They contribute to make the EU a global player.\", \"What are the challenges that the outermost regions face?\": \"The outermost regions face many permanent constraints to their development such as remoteness, insularity, small size, vulnerability to climate change, and economic dependence on a few sectors. In addition, the coronavirus pandemic has hit their economies particularly hard. While these regions are quite different from one another, they have levels of unemployment and GDP significantly worse than EU and national averages. Youth unemployment is above 50% in the Canary Islands and Mayotte, and around 40% in Guadeloupe, Martinique, and Re\\u0301union, much higher than the EU average of 16.8%. GDP in purchasing power parity compared to the EU average ranged from 30% in Mayotte (EU lowest) or French Guiana (46%) to 76% (Martinique). (source: Eurostat). The 8th Cohesion Report shows that the GDP per head in the outermost regions remained at the same level or even decreased between 2001-2019.employment rates were below the EU average in the outermost regions in 2020; unemployment rates in the Canary Islands and Mayotte were over three times higher than the EU average.the population growth rate is relatively high in most of the outermost regions. In Mayotte and French Guiana, the population grew rapidly between 2010 and 2020. In contrast, the population in the Azores, Madeira, Guadeloupe and Martinique decreased over the past decade.some of the largest shares of early leavers from education and training are in two outermost regions, the Azores and French Guiana, both with more than 25%.\", \"Why a renewed Strategy for the outermost regions?\": \"Article 349 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union provides for specific measures to support the outermost regions, including the tailored application of EU law and access to EU programmes. Following the implementation of the 2017 Strategy, and given the new context in the aftermath of the pandemic, the Commission shaped a renewed Strategy prioritising place-based approaches and tailored support for the outermost regions across all EU policies. The Strategy thus reflects the Commission's unwavering commitment towards these regions in line with article 349 of the Treaty.\", \"How will this renewed Strategy address the challenges of the outermost regions?\": \"The renewed Strategy will focus on five pillars: Putting people first - improving living conditions for people in the outermost regions, ensuring people's quality of life, addressing poverty and developing youth opportunities.Building on each regions' unique assets such as biodiversity, blue economy or research potential and by addressing their constraints.Supporting a sustainable, environmentally friendly and climate-neutral economic transformation grounded on a green and digital transition.Strengthening outermost regions' regional cooperation with neighbouring countries and territories.Strengthened partnership, support and dialogue with outermost regions via, among others, dedicated administrative capacity and awareness raising measures to step up these regions participation in EU programmes.\", \"Why is \\u2018putting people first' the motto of this renewed Strategy?\": \"The Strategy focuses on the social dimension of the outermost regions to implement the European Pillar of Social Rights and the EU Child Guarantee, and improve health. Young people living in the outermost regions need to have access to education and employment opportunities. Through its inclusion and diversity Strategy, the Commission helps young people from these regions participating in Erasmus+ and the European Solidarity Corps. During the European Year of Youth 2022 various initiatives will empower young people, including a new initiative aimed exclusively at youth from the outermost regions. The Commission will launch a \\u20ac1 million grant scheme empowering them to shape and implement projects at local level, with a specific attention to equality and inclusion.\", \"What does the Strategy bring concretely to the outermost regions?\": \"The new Strategy puts a strong emphasis on the social dimension in the outermost regions, by putting people first. The Commission will help these regions and their Member States improving access to housing, water, healthcare, transport, education and training. The new Strategy also creates new opportunities with dedicated funding for the outermost regions. For example, it announces upcoming tailored calls for projects to support: youth (with a grant scheme for young people financed by the European Regional and Development Fund - ERDF)blue economy (through the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund)innovation (through the Interregional Innovation Investment initiative by the ERDF)research (through the Horizon Europe programme)biodiversity (through the LIFE programme). Moreover, with the new Strategy, the Commission will provide tailored support to help the outermost regions using the wide array of opportunities created for them in EU funds and programmes in 2021-2027. For this purpose, the Commission will: create a new advisory support tool on demand to help the outermost regions making the most out of EU opportunities, to address their administrative capacity issues, help them shape regional development plans and identify synergies between EU funds and programmes and taking into account their specificities in future legislative proposals.organise workshops on EU programmes.strengthen dialogue and outreach towards the outermost regions on EU opportunities.\", \"How does the Strategy respond to outermost regions proposals?\": \"To shape the Strategy, the Commission launched a public consultation as well as targeted consultations and bilateral meetings with the outermost regions and their Member States. It took into account a Declaration by the outermost regions' Presidents of November 2021; a position paper of the outermost regions and their Member States of January 2022; and resolutions and opinions by the European Parliament, the European Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee. The Strategy addresses the regions' proposals notably on social policies, health, State aid, energy, administrative capacity and the creation of dedicated calls for these regions.  It will address social and health challenges in these regions through EU tools and funds. Moreover, the Commission commits itself to taking outermost regions' specificities into account in future policies and legislative proposals such as in the revision of State aid rules across sectors. To address administrative capacity challenges in the regions, the Commission will create a new advisory support tool to help shape regional development plans and make best use of EU funds and programmes.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_2592\": {\"What is the Mission for Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities?\": \"The Mission for Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities \\u201cCities Mission\\u201d is one of five EU Missions, a novelty of the Horizon Europe research and innovation programme for the years 2021-2027. They are a new way to bring concrete solutions to some of our greatest challenges. Working towards ambitious goals, they are expected to deliver tangible results by 2030. The Cities Mission will involve local authorities, citizens, businesses, investors as well as regional and national authorities to: Deliver 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030; Ensure that these cities act as experimentation and innovation hubs to enable all European cities to follow suit by 2050.\", \"How were the selected cities chosen?\": \"The Commission launched a Call for Expression of Interest addressed to cities, open between 25 November 2021 and 31 January 2022. This call allowed cities to state their interest in becoming climate-neutral by 2030 as part of the Mission and to submit information on their current situation, ongoing work, and plans on climate neutrality. The Commission applied a rigorous procedure to select cities in an objective and fair manner. 377 cities from all EU Member States as well as nine associated or potentially associated countries submitted an expression of interest. 362 of them were found to be eligible. Firstly, independent experts evaluated each expression of interest. Secondly, the Commission used additional criteria to ensure geographical balance as well as balance in terms of city characteristics. Various cities were chosen: some \\u201cfront-running\\u201d cities; some larger cities with the potential to have a stronger impact in terms of climate neutrality; some cities with innovative ideas on how to deliver the digital or smart dimension of the mission, etc. This diversity is essential to pave the way for all cities to be climate neutral by 2050.\", \"What are the next steps for the selected cities?\": \"The most important elements of this Mission are the Climate City Contracts, which are to be drawn up, signed and implemented by each participating city. They should set out action plans for the city to achieve climate neutrality by 2030 and include an investment plan. While not legally binding, these contracts will constitute a clear and highly visible political commitment to the EU, national and regional authorities and citizens. Climate City Contracts will be co-created with local partners and citizens, with the help of a Mission Platform run by the project NetZeroCities. The Mission Platform will provide the necessary technical, regulatory and financial assistance to cities. The selected cities will be contacted by the Mission Platform following the public announcement of the list of cities with practical information about the next steps. A first webinar for participating cities will be organised in the coming days.\", \"What is the budget allocated for this?\": \"In total, Horizon Europe will invest \\u20ac360 million in the Mission Platform and in research and innovation actions linked to the Mission (e.g. in mobility, energy, urban planning) in the period 2021-23. A first full work programme was published in December 2021. However, this can only be seed funding, and the Commission will work to help mobilise additional funding and financing from public and private sources.\", \"Why limit the support of the Mission to 100 cities when so many more applied?\": \"The Mission's approach is based on individual and tailor-made support to cities, based on their specific needs. The budget limits the number of cities at this stage. However, the Cities Mission and the Mission Platform also plan to ensure that a number of services will be available to a much larger group of cities, including those that have expressed their interest and were not selected, such as twinning and teaming, web-based assistance, webinars. We will also look at what more can be done, including through Horizon Europe projects, based on the needs identified in cities' expressions of interest.\", \"What will happen to the cities, which submitted an expression of interest to join the Mission but were not selected?\": \"Cities that were not selected were informed by the Commission. The Commission is still committed to work with them and to help them fulfil their objectives. They have been informed of the possibilities to remain connected and work with the Cities Mission, including: Services from the Mission Platform: the Mission Platform can already offer services to the group of cities that want to work on climate neutrality with a 2030 timescale, but that were not selected in the call, and the Commission is considering dedicating additional resources for this purpose through forthcoming calls under Horizon Europe. National networks: in some countries, national networks are already being formed in support of applicant cities. A number of countries have announced or are planning to announce that they are intending to support a wider group of cities, whether or not they are selected, including in several cases with financial assistance. Local/regional efforts: on top of these national networks, the Commission is going to encourage the development of regional networks and \\u201cclusters\\u201d or \\u201cteams\\u201d of cities to be formed to work together on climate neutrality. R&I projects under the Cities Mission Work Programme of Horizon Europe: calls are open to all cities that commit to the objectives of the Cities Mission and cities may find interesting opportunities to get involved in such projects.\", \"Why were additional 12 cities from non-EU countries chosen?\": \"The Call for Expression of Interest was open to EU cities as well as to cities from countries associated to Horizon Europe and to countries with the potential of becoming associated.  Given the strength of the interest from the EU side alone, 100 EU cities were invited to join the programme, but an additional 12 cities were chosen based on the same criteria as applied for the selection of EU cities. Cities from Associated Countries will be treated the same as EU cities, but of course will not have the same access to other EU funds such as Cohesion Funds.\", \"How will national and regional authorities be involved in the implementation of the Mission?\": \"The role of national and regional authorities will be key in the implementation of the Mission. National networks already exist in some countries, and the Commission is working closely with Member States to develop these networks further and to encourage the establishment of similar networks in countries where they do not exist yet. We are also urging cities, national and regional authorities to work together in the co-creation process leading to each city's Climate City Contract.  National and regional authorities have a key role to play for example in providing financial and regulatory support.\", \"What happens if cities do not meet the climate neutrality target?\": \"The Climate City Contracts will not be legally binding. There will be no legal consequences. That said, the contracts will be a very visible commitment that the mayor or political representative of the city will have made towards their national authorities, the Commission and towards the city's inhabitants.\", \"What links are there with other EU programmes or other Missions?\": \"The Cities Mission is not seeking to replace any other initiative targeted at cities, but to build on what is already there. If a city already has a Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) in line with the methodology of the Covenant of Mayors or a Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP), its Climate City Contract should build on that.  The Mission will continue to work closely with existing EU programmes such as the Covenant of Mayors and the European Climate Pact. Synergies with other Missions will be very important, in particular with the Mission on Climate Adaptation and the Mission on Oceans. The direct involvement of citizens in the European Climate Pact as drivers of change and ambassadors for climate neutrality will help the Mission bring citizens closer to the design, implementation and monitoring of mission activities. The Mission also contributes to the objectives of the new EU Cohesion Policy and particularly to the policy objective of \\u201ca greener, low-carbon transitioning towards a net zero carbon economy and resilient Europe by promoting clean and fair energy transition, green and blue investment, the circular economy, climate change mitigation and adaptation, risk prevention and management, and sustainable urban mobility\\u201d. The European Urban Initiative (EUI), which is sought to provide coherent support to cities supporting urban innovation, capacity and knowledge building, territorial impact assessments, policy development and communication, offers many possibilities for synergies.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_2655\": {\"Why is the Commission proposing a legal migration package?\": \"The Commission is today proposing  a set of \\u2018Skills and Talent' proposals to address current demographic and migration challenges in the EU and prepare for future needs. The proposals are a deliverable of the EU's comprehensive approach under the Pact on Migration and Asylum.  An ambitious and sustainable EU legal migration policy will help to attract talent our economies need and create safe channels to reach Europe, supporting the EU's green and digital transition, while contributing to making European societies more cohesive and resilient. The proposals address a number of persisting challenges including: the recovery of EU's economy after the COVID-19 pandemic; the EU's labour market shortages; the need to support the labour market integration of people fleeing Russia's invasion of Ukraine; and to accompany the EU's transition to green and digital economy.\", \"Why do we need to revise the Long-term Residents and Single Permit Directives?\": \"To address labour market shortages and to ensure that the EU attracts the skills and talent it needs, an efficient legislative framework is required to improve legal migration to the EU. The Long-Term Residents Directive and the Single Permit Directive set the framework in terms of procedures and rights for a large part of the non-EU workers legally residing in the EU. However, both pieces of legislation have not fully achieved the objectives for which they were first adopted, in 2003 and 2011 respectively. The Long-Term Residents Directive is under-used by the Member States and does not provide for an effective right to mobility within the EU. The Single Permit Directive has not fully achieved its objective of simplifying admission procedures for all workers from non-EU countries. For these reasons, the Commission is proposing an overall revision of the two Directives. The main objectives are to make procedures more efficient and quicker, strengthen the mobility within the EU of nationals of non-EU countries that are already residing and working in the EU, further integration and prevent labour exploitation.\", \"What are the main legislative changes proposed in the skills and talent package that the Commission is presenting?\": \"The Commission is proposing to update the Single Permit Directive to further streamline the application procedure for a combined work and residence permit and enhance safeguards for equal treatment and protection from labour exploitation. The main changes to the Single Permit Directive include: An obligation for Member States to accept applications filed both in the Member State of destination and from a third country;The 4 month time limit for issuing a decision must also cover the issuing of the requisite entry visa and the time needed to conduct a labour market test;The right for the permit holder to change employer during the permit's validity. The permit should also not be withdrawn in the event of unemployment for at least 3 months; andNew provisions on penalties against employers in case of violations of working conditions, freedom of association and access to social security benefits and to introduce complaints mechanisms. The Commission is also proposing to update the Long Term Residents Directive to make it easier to acquire the long-term residence status by simplifying the admission conditions and to enhance rights of residents and their family members, including the rights to move and work in another EU Member State. The main changes to the Long Term Residents Directive include: The required 5-year period of residence can be cumulative in different Member States. Periods of residence under temporary and national protection, and as students should also be counted;Member States should put in place control mechanisms to monitor the actual residence of investors and ensure that this status is not abused.Improved right to family reunification without integration conditions, with full access to work for family members, and children of long-term residents born in the EU may acquire the status immediately; andFacilitated intra-EU mobility.\", \"Why do we need legal migration?\": \"Legal migration brings benefits to our society and the economy. It supports the recovery of EU's economy after the COVID-19 pandemic; it addresses EU's labour market shortages and it accompanies the EU's transition to a green and digital economy. In the last decade, migrant workers accounted for a significant part of new jobs in the EU, helping to address labour market shortages. Such shortages increase the pressure on labour markets, undermining competitiveness and economic growth. Migration and mobility are and will continue to be inherent features of humanity, globally and in the EU. On 1 January 2021, 23.7 million nationals from non-EU countries were residing in the EU, representing 5.3% of the total population. Irregular migration to the EU remains limited despite benefitting from widespread media coverage. Annually, approximately 2.25 to 3 million nationals from non-EU countries come to the EU using legal channels, in contrast to 125,000 to 200,000 irregular arrivals. Please see the Commission's latest statistics on asylum and migration for more information. Labour migration not only has an economic dimension, it also improves overall migration management as it helps strengthen our cooperation with countries of origin and transit, including by reducing irregular migration. There is therefore a strong political and economic case for establishing more effective legal routes for migrants to enter Europe. This is, however, nuanced by the acknowledgement of the diverging situations and policies of the EU's Member States. Legal migration is a shared competence between the European Union and its Member States. Member States alone decide on the number of nationals from non-EU countries coming to their territory in order to seek work.\", \"Why is the Commission creating the EU Talent pilot project specifically for people fleeing Russia's invasion of Ukraine?\": \"The Russian invasion of Ukraine created an immediate need to accommodate over 5 million people who have fled to the EU. The first-ever activation of the Temporary Protection Directive allows access to accommodation, schools, healthcare and jobs for Ukrainian nationals and their family members. This summer, in order to support successful integration in the labour market, the Commission will launch an EU Talent Pool pilot initiative. The EU-wide platform will help to map and match the skills and qualifications of beneficiaries of temporary protection with potential employers locally or in another EU Member State, taking into account the specific needs of the applicants.\", \"What will be the difference between the EU Talent Pool and the EU Talent Pool pilot project?\": \"Skilled nationals from outside of the EU who are interested in working in the EU will be able to register on a web platform and be admitted to the EU Talent Pool on the basis of specific skills levels or other relevant criteria. The Commission aims to formally launch the EU Talent Pool and its web portal by mid-2023. The EU Talent Pool pilot initiative is being launched in response to the urgent need to accommodate those fleeing Ukraine's invasion by Russia, in order to match them with potential employers across the EU and this way to facilitate their labour market integration in the EU. There will be no admission criteria and people can upload their profiles from within the EU. The aim is to set up the pilot initiative by summer 2022.\", \"What kind of legal framework is the Commission's proposal to launch the Talent pool in mid-2023 going to have?\": \"By mid-2023 the Commission will adopt a recommendation establishing the Talent Pool, its charter and presenting a roadmap for the gradual development of its components. Establishing such a legal basis in the future could be set as an objective in the longer term.\", \"How does the Commission intend to roll-out Talent Partnerships and with which non-EU countries?\": \"Each Talent Partnership should be tailor-made on the basis of needs and interests of Member States and partner countries. In order to effectively roll-out Talent Partnerships, the Commission is proposing today to launch specific Talent Partnerships, taking into account the overall state of relations on all aspects of the comprehensive approach under the Pact on Migration and Asylum, as well as the Member States' and partner countries' interests in overall cooperation on labour mobility and talent development. Once there is an overall agreement on the content, design and implementation of a Talent Partnership with a specific partner country, a combination of various financial instruments will mobilise funding. As a first step, following high-level discussions and strong and continuous cooperation on all aspects of migration management, including on irregular migration, the Commission has the intention to launch the first Talent Partnerships with North African partners, in particular Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt by the end of the year. The launch of Talent Partnerships with other partner countries in Africa and Asia will be considered in parallel, as part of a gradual approach.\", \"With which other countries does the Commission envisage launching Talent Partnerships?\": \"As part of a gradual approach, the launch of Talent Partnerships with other partner countries in Africa and Asia will be a natural next step in the process of strengthened cooperation on migration management. It is envisaged to start assessing the feasibility of launching Talent Partnerships with Pakistan, Bangladesh, Senegal and Nigeria, as one of the key components of a reinforced migration management cooperation with these countries.\", \"What will be the purpose of the newly proposed labour migration platform?\": \"Progress in the area of labour migration will depend on closer cooperation and a better understanding between the migration and the employment sectors. The Commission is therefore launching a new platform for labour migration, for exchanges with Member States' experts from both these sectors, at the operational level, drawing on the experience of other stakeholders. The platform will enable technical discussion on practical issues of labour migration and labour shortages and it will also support the developments of Talent Partnerships and the EU Talent Pool.\", \"Why do you focus on the long-term care sector?\": \"As underlined by President von der Leyen in her 2021 State of the Union Speech, the care sector is a key area where the EU should do more to support men and women in finding the best care. Long-term care systems differ across the EU, but all countries face common challenges to provide accessible, affordable and high-quality care in the context of a growing demand for health and social care and staff shortages in an ageing population. Migrants form an important part of the long-term care workforce. In addition to its high societal importance, the long-term care sector has a large economic and job creation potential. The formal long-term care sector already employs about 6.3 million people, which represents around 3.2% of the EU's entire workforce. During the COVID-19 crisis, long-term care was identified as an essential service. However, limited investments in the sector and staff shortages contributed to significant challenges in ensuring continuity of care services and adequate response to the pandemic. Member States struggle to attract and retain care workers. In the long-term care sector, up to 7 million job openings for healthcare associate professionals and personal care workers are expected to emerge by 2030. The Commission will therefore explore initiatives to help improve the admission of this essential category of workers, to benefit at the same time all Member States and countries of origin, while guaranteeing high ethical standards of recruitment.\", \"Why is youth mobility important?\": \"Giving young people a chance to live, work and acquire experience in another country can foster cultural exchanges and strengthen ties between countries, while also contributing to the economy. To this end, many countries in the world have developed Youth mobility schemes. An EU Youth Mobility Scheme could make the EU as a whole a more attractive destination for skilled young people from non-EU countries. At the same time, as these schemes are normally based on reciprocity, an EU youth mobility scheme would allow young Europeans to have more chances to travel and acquire experience in countries outside the EU. For these reasons, the Commission will explore the feasibility of developing an EU Youth Mobility Scheme, testing various options in particular for agreements with non-EU countries enabling reciprocity.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_2507\": {\"Why is the Commission proposing visa-free travel to the EU for Qatar and Kuwait nationals?\": \"The Commission is proposing today to lift visa requirements for Qatar and Kuwait nationals following a positive assessment of the criteria set in the EU rules on visa requirements (Regulation (EU) 2018/1806). This Regulation lists the non-EU countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The criteria include irregular immigration, public policy and security, economic benefit, in particular in terms of tourism and foreign trade, and the Union's external relations with the relevant non-EU countries, as well as the implications of regional coherence and reciprocity. The assessment of the Commission concluded that the countries concerned present low irregular migration risks. Moderate security risks stemming from the region can be mitigated through increased cooperation on security, checks at the EU's external borders, as well as with the upcoming entry into operation of the EU Entry-Exit System (EES) and of the pre-travel screening of visa-free travellers (European Travel Information and Authorisation System). Qatar and Kuwait also present external relations interests for the EU. The assessment highlights the important economic interest for the EU, in terms of trade, energy cooperation and tourism. Both countries have undertaken reforms in the area of human rights. You can find more detailed information on the Commission's assessment in the Staff Working Document issued today.\", \"What will visa-free travel to the EU for Qatari and Kuwaiti nationals mean in practice?\": \"Once the proposal is agreed, Qatar and Kuwait nationals with biometric passports will no longer need visas when travelling to the Schengen area for short stays of up to 90 days. This covers travel to all EU Member States except for Ireland, as well as to the four Schengen associated countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland). Visa-free travellers will continue to be checked against the Schengen Information System and Member State's national databases at the EU's external borders, to verify that they fulfil the entry requirements. Visa-exempt travellers visiting the Schengen area will also be subject to the EU Entry/Exit System (EES) as of the second half of 2022 and to the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) as of May 2023.\", \"What happens if the criteria for visa exemption cease to be fulfilled?\": \"The Commission will monitor the visa-free status. If a country no longer meets the criteria for visa exemption, the Commission can propose to transfer it back to the list of visa-required countries. In addition, the visa suspension mechanism and the visa reciprocity mechanism allow the Commission and Member States to trigger a suspension of the visa exemption in case of increased irregular migration or security risks, including risks linked to investor citizenship or residence schemes, or if a visa-free non-EU country introduces a visa requirement for EU citizens.\", \"Is the Commission planning to propose granting visa-free travel to more countries?\": \"The Commission is monitoring the situation and may propose new visa exemptions in the future where appropriate based on an assessment against the criteria set in the EU rules on visa requirements (Regulation (EU) 2018/1806). In particular, the EU will continue engaging with the remaining visa-required Gulf Cooperation Council countries that are interested in visa-free travel to the EU. The Commission will shortly launch technical discussions with these partners on the fulfilment of criteria for visa exemption under the Visa Regulation. The final objective is to achieve visa free travel for all Gulf Cooperation Council countries.\", \"What are the next steps?\": \"It is now for the European Parliament and the Council to examine the proposal and decide whether to grant visa-free travel to the EU to nationals of Qatar and Kuwait. If the proposal is adopted by the European Parliament and the Council, the EU will negotiate a visa waiver agreement with Qatar and Kuwait, respectively. Such agreements would include concrete commitments to ensure the maintenance of the visa-free status and provide for full visa reciprocity for EU citizens. Visa-free travel to the EU for nationals of Qatar and Kuwait will start applying once the visa waiver agreement enters into force.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_2583\": {\"Why is the Commission proposing to introduce online visa applications?\": \"The Commission is proposing today the digitalisation of the Schengen visa process, replacing the visa sticker, and introducing the ability to submit visa applications online through a European online visa platform. Through digitalisation, applying for a Schengen visa will become easier and the visa itself will be more secure and less vulnerable to theft and fraud. The von der Leyen Commission's objective during its mandate has been to develop the Union's visa policy as a tool towards a more modern, customer-friendly and secure way of managing third-country nationals' travel to the Schengen area, which we have so far done with the adoption of the proposal to modernise the Visa Information System, the ongoing development of the Entry-Exit and ETIAS (European Travel Information Authorisation) systems and the implementation of the new Visa Code, including its Article 25(a) on cooperation on readmission. When revising the EU Visa Code in 2019, the European Parliament and the Council explicitly stated the aim of developing a common solution to allow Schengen visa applications to be lodged online in the future, making full use of the recent legal and technological developments. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to the slowing down of Schengen visa operations worldwide partly due to the difficulty of receiving visa applicants in consulates and visa application centres, prompted Member States to call upon the Commission to speed up work on digitalisation of visa procedures. Finally, the Pact on Migration and Asylum, proposed by the Commission in September 2020, set the objective of making the visa procedure fully digitalised by 2025, with the introduction of a digital visa and the ability to submit visa applications online.\", \"Will it still be possible to apply through paper application?\": \"In principle, all visa applications will be submitted digitally through the EU Visa Application platform. However, in individual cases applicants would still be able to submit a paper application at a consulate or a visa application centre if the assistance (via chat-box and Q&A section) provided by the EU Visa Application platform or by family or friends is not sufficient to apply online. Specific provisions will also apply in case of humanitarian reasons. Family members of EU/European Economic Area citizens who are exercising their right of free movement will also be able to continue to apply through paper applications.\", \"Will applicants still need to go to consulates in person to apply for a visa?\": \"All applicants will be able to lodge their application fully online (fill in the application form, pay the visa fee, upload supporting documents and check if biometrics are still valid). Nevertheless, for first-time applicants or applicants whose biometrics are no longer valid, a visit to the consulate or Visa Application Centre will be needed to provide biometric identifiers. Applicants, who will need to appear in person, will be able to book an appointment online.\", \"Why will the digital visa be more secure than a paper one?\": \"The fact that the visa is issued on paper makes it more vulnerable to fraud and theft which poses risks to the security of the EU. The digital visa will be an electronic record in the Visa Information System and thus the visa will no longer have any physical features that can be tampered with.\", \"Will it be easier to get a visa with this proposal?\": \"Although the digitalisation proposal will make it easier to apply for a visa, it does not change the conditions that must be met when submitting an application and its subsequent examination.\", \"Who will build and manage the future application platform?\": \"The platform will be built and maintained by eu-LISA (European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice). The Commission will be responsible for ensuring that the general visa information on the platform is up to date.\", \"How will the application process via the platform look like for applicants?\": \"First, the applicants will check on the EU Visa Application platform whether they need a visa. If they do, they will then create a secure account, fill out an application form and upload all the necessary documents. Subsequently applicants will pay online the visa fees and submit their application. The Schengen country which is the main destination of the trip will be in charge of examining the application. Applicants will be able to check the status of their application via the platform and will receive notifications about its status. Once the visa has been approved, applicants will be able to access it online. If needed, they will also be able to extend their visa period online.\", \"What are the advantages of having a single European portal (for applicants and for Member States)?\": \"A single application platform will provide applicants with one harmonised and seamless application procedure irrespective of the Schengen country they wish to visit. It will enable them to access all their submitted applications in one place. This would not be the case with Member States' own portals. Applicants would be faced with different procedures and they would have to access different systems to view their previous applications.\", \"What about the existing national portals?\": \"The Commission proposes to gradually phase out these national portals and replace them by a single application platform at EU level. The Commission has chosen to give the possibility to Member states to join the platform as soon as it becomes operational and at the latest five years after its establishment. This transition period will allow Member States phasing out smoothly their national tools and joining the EU Visa Application platform in a flexible manner.\", \"How will the EU visa application platform protect the personal data of applicants?\": \"EU Visa Application platform will be part of the recently revised Visa Information System, which has been recently upgraded and contains state-of-the-art data protection safeguards (purpose limitation, limited retention period).\", \"Is today's proposal linked to the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS)?\": \"Both systems aim to facilitate travel to Schengen area while also strengthening its security. The proposed initiative applies to visa-required non-EU nationals, i.e. for non-EU nationals who need to apply for a visa when they wish to stay in the Schengen area for a period not exceeding 90 days in any 180 days period.  ETIAS is to be used by non-EU nationals who are exempt from the visa requirement but who do need to apply for a Travel Authorisation prior to their trip.\", \"When will the new system become operational?\": \"The Commission proposal will now be discussed at the European Parliament and the Council. Based on the Commission's proposal, Member States will have five years to switch to the common online visa platform. Based on the outcome of the negotiations between the co-legislators, the development of the platform could start in 2024 and become operational in 2026. Considering the five year transition period, all Member States could use the platform in 2031.\", \"Will this proposal apply to Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and Cyprus?\": \"The proposal, once voted, will be applied by the countries applying in full the Schengen acquis:  the EU27 (except Ireland and Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Cyprus as not applying the Schengen acquis in full) + Iceland, Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland. This is 26 countries in total. Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Cyprus do not apply the Schengen acquis in full and do not issue Schengen visas, nor do they have access to the Visa Information System. They will, therefore not apply this proposal which relates to the issuing of Schengen visas.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_20_2349\": {\"What is the Digital Markets Act?\": \"The Digital Markets Act introduces rules for platforms that act as \\u201cgatekeepers\\u201d in the digital sector. These are platforms that have a significant impact on the internal market, serve as an important gateway for business users to reach their end users, and which enjoy, or will foreseeably enjoy, an entrenched and durable position. This can grant them the power to act as private rule-makers and to function as bottlenecks between businesses and end users. The Digital Markets Act aims at preventing gatekeepers from imposing unfair conditions on businesses and end users and at ensuring the openness of important digital services.    Examples of changes that gatekeepers will have to implement include ensuring end users can easily unsubscribe from core platform services or uninstall pre-installed core platform services, stopping the installation of software by default alongside the operating system, providing advertising performance data and ad pricing information, allowing developers to use alternative in-app payment systems or allowing end users to download alternative app stores. Common rules across the single market will foster innovation, growth and competitiveness, and facilitate the scaling up of smaller platforms, small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups who will have a single, clear framework at EU level.\", \"Who will be subject to the Digital Markets Act?\": \"The Digital Markets Act will be applicable only to companies that will be identified as \\u201cgatekeepers\\u201d according to objective criteria set out in the proposal. These are companies that play a particularly important role in the internal market because of their size and their importance as gateways for business users to reach their customers. As a precondition, these companies need to be identified as gatekeeper for at least one of the so-called \\u201ccore platform services\\u201d enumerated in the DMA (such as online search engines, social networking services, app stores, certain messaging services, virtual assistants, web browsers, operating systems and online intermediation services). The same company can be identified as gatekeeper for several core platform services. Specifically, there are three main cumulative criteria that bring a company under the scope of the DMA: A size that impacts the internal market: this is presumed to be the case if the company achieves an annual turnover in the European Economic Area (EEA) equal to or above \\u20ac7.5 billion in in each of the last three financial years, or where its average market capitalisation or equivalent fair market value amounted to at least \\u20ac75 billion in the last financial year, and it provides a core platform service in at least three Member States;The control of an important gateway for business users towards final consumers: this is presumed to be the case if the company operates a core platform service with more than 45 million monthly active end users established or located in the EU and more than 10,000 yearly active business users established in the EU in the last financial year;An entrenched and durable position: this is presumed to be the case if the company met the other two criteria in each of the last three financial years. Companies that satisfy the above criteria are presumed gatekeepers but have the opportunity to rebut the presumption and submit substantiated arguments to demonstrate that due to exceptional circumstances it should not be designated as a gatekeeper despite meeting all the thresholds. Conversely, the Commission may launch an investigation to assess in more detail the specific situation of a given company and decide to nonetheless identify the company as a gatekeeper on the basis of a qualitative assessment, even if it does not meet the quantitative thresholds.\", \"What are the consequences of being identified as a gatekeeper under the Digital Markets Act?\": \"Gatekeepers will carry an extra responsibility to conduct themselves in a way that ensures an open online environment that is fair for businesses and consumers, and open to innovation by all, by complying with specific obligations laid down in the draft legislation. Under the DMA, companies identified as gatekeepers will be subject to a number of dos and don'ts.  They will therefore have to proactively implement certain behaviours that make the markets more open and contestable and at the same time refrain from engaging in unfair behaviour, which is defined in the legislation in the light of market experience to date including from competition cases. When a company does not yet enjoy an entrenched and durable position, but it is foreseeable that it will in the near future, a proportionate subset of obligations will apply, to ensure that the gatekeeper concerned does not achieve by unfair means an entrenched and durable position in its operations.\", \"Under the final agreement, which are the types of core platform services that are covered by the Digital Markets Act?\": \"Based on the final agreement between the co-legislators, ten core platform services will be subject to the DMA: online intermediation services;online search engines;online social networking services;video-sharing platform services;number-independent interpersonal communication services;operating systems;cloud computing services;advertising services;web browsers;virtual assistants. Of these ten core platform services, eight were part of the Commission's initial proposal, and during the negotiations, two core platform services (virtual assistants and web browsers) were added to the list initially proposed by the Commission. The inclusion of these two additional core platform services is justified based on the developments since the DMA has been proposed in December 2020. Such developments include, among others, findings of the sector inquiry into the consumer Internet of Things, which looked into voice assistants, as well as recent enforcement experience and broader developments when it comes to web browsers.\", \"What are the \\u201cdos and don'ts\\u201d for gatekeepers?\": \"The Digital Markets Act establishes a series of obligations that gatekeepers will need to implement in their daily operations to ensure fair and open digital markets. This will open up possibilities for companies to contest markets based on the merits of their products and services and innovate. Some examples of the \\u201cdos\\u201d imposed on gatekeepers include the following: Allow end users end users to easily un-install pre-installed apps or change default settings on operating systems, virtual assistants or web browsers that steer them to the products and services of the gatekeeper and provide choice screens for key services;Allow end users to install third party apps or app stores that use or interoperate with the operating system of the gatekeeper;Allow end users to unsubscribe from core platform services of the gatekeeper as easily as they subscribe to them;Allow third parties to inter-operate with the gatekeeper's own services;Provide the companies advertising on their platform with access to the performance measuring tools of the gatekeeper and the information necessary for advertisers and publishers to carry out their own independent verification of their advertisements hosted by the gatekeeper;Allow business users to promote their offers and conclude contracts with their customers outside the gatekeeper's platform;Provide business users with access to the data generated by their activities on the gatekeeper's platform. Some example of the \\u201cdon'ts\\u201d imposed on the gatekeepers include the following to: Ban on using the data of business users when gatekeepers compete with them on their own platform;Ban on ranking the gatekeeper's own products or services in a more favourable manner compared to those of third parties;Ban on requiring app developers to use certain of the gatekeeper's services (such as payment systems or identity providers) in order to appear in app stores of the gatekeeper;Ban on tracking end users outside of the gatekeepers' core platform service for the purpose of targeted advertising, without effective consent having been granted.\", \"What changes will it make for interoperability of messenger services?\": \"The final political agreement includes an interoperability obligation for gatekeepers providing messenger services concerning basic functionalities. This obligation will apply upon request by third party providers. Gatekeepers will have to respond in a fixed timeline. Some basic functionalities have to be made available for interoperability from the entry in to force of the DMA, (e.g. text messages between two individual users), more complex ones will be introduced gradually and have to be made available after two years (e.g. group text messages) or four years (e.g. audio and video calls between two individual users or groups of end users) from the moment of designation. It is important to stress that non-gatekeepers service providers of messenger services are not obliged to implement interoperability, meaning they are free to choose either to benefit from such interoperability obligation that falls upon the gatekeeper, or to keep their service separate from the gatekeeper. In addition, end users will equally have the choice to use or refuse such an option, where their provider has decided to interoperate with a gatekeeper. The final agreement on the interoperability obligation also ensures that the levels of service integrity, security and encryption offered by the gatekeeper shall and will not be reduced.\", \"What is the final decision on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory access conditions? Is the Digital Markets Act changing the copyright rules?\": \"The final agreement ensures an obligation of ensuring fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory general conditions of access in a targeted manner to app stores, online search engines and online social networking services. The Digital Markets Act is without prejudice to the Copyright Directive and its transposition in the Member States. The Digital Markets Act will impose an obligation on gatekeepers to design their general access conditions in a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory manner and to publish them. Finally, gatekeepers will have to offer an alternative dispute settlement mechanism in case of a disagreement between the gatekeeper and a business user as regards the application of such general conditions of access.\", \"How does the Digital Markets Act work in practice?\": \"Once the Digital Markets Act enters into force, the Commission will first assess whether companies active in core platform services qualify as a \\u201cgatekeeper\\u201d under the DMA: Companies will have to verify themselves if they meet the quantitative thresholds included in the DMA to identify gatekeepers. They will then have to provide the Commission with information on this;The Commission will then designate as \\u201cgatekeepers\\u201d those companies that meet the thresholds in the DMA based on the information provided by the companies (subject to a possible substantiated rebuttal) and/or following a market investigation;Within six months after a company is identified as a \\u201cgatekeeper\\u201d, it will have to comply with the \\u201cdos\\u201d and \\u201cdon'ts\\u201d listed in the DMA. For those gatekeepers that do not yet enjoy an entrenched and durable position, but are expected to do so in the near future, only those obligations apply that are necessary and appropriate to ensure that the company does not achieve by unfair means such entrenched and durable position in its operations.\", \"What happens if a gatekeeper ignores the rules?\": \"To ensure the effectiveness of the new rules, the possibility of sanctions for non-compliance with the prohibitions and obligations is foreseen. If a gatekeeper does not comply with the rules, the Commission can impose fines of up to 10% of the company's total worldwide annual turnover or 20% in the event of repeated infringements and periodic penalty payments of up to 5% of the company's total worldwide daily turnover. In case of systematic infringements the Commission can impose additional remedies. Where necessary to achieve compliance, and where no alternative, equally effective measures are available, these can include structural remedies, such as obliging a gatekeeper to sell a business, or parts of it (i.e. selling units, assets, intellectual property rights or brands), or banning a gatekeeper from acquiring any company that provides services in the digital sector or services enabling the collection of data affected by the systematic non-compliance.\", \"How to ensure that the new rules are future proof in view of the fast-evolving digital sector?\": \"Ensuring that the Digital Markets Act is and remains future proof has been a key objective of the Commission from the start, and it was strongly retained in the final agreement. To this end, the Commission is empowered under the Digital Markets Act to supplement the existing obligations applicable to gatekeepers based on a market investigation, which may translate into a supplementary act (delegated act), or a review of the DMA. This should ensure that the same issues of fairness and contestability are tackled also where the practices of gatekeepers and digital markets evolve. In addition to supplementing the obligations, the Commission will be able to designate so-called \\u2018emerging' gatekeepers that are on a clear path to making services tip to their advantage. This way the instrument is both very precise and therefore easily implementable and effective, as well as flexible enough to keep pace with developments in the fast-evolving digital sector.\", \"What is the purpose of market investigations under the Digital Markets Act?\": \"To ensure that the new gatekeeper rules keep up with the fast pace of digital markets, the Commission will have the power to carry out market investigations. The purpose of market investigations is three-fold: Identifying gatekeepers that are not captured by the quantitative thresholds foreseen in the Digital Markets Act, or which meet these thresholds but have presented a substantiated submission rebutting the presumption based on these thresholds;Identifying whether other services within the digital sector should be added to the list of core platform services falling within the scope of the Regulation, or whether new practices appear which risk having the same detrimental effects as those already covered;Designing additional remedies for when a gatekeeper has systematically infringed the rules of the Digital Markets Act.\", \"Who will enforce the Digital Markets Act?\": \"The Commission will be the sole enforcer of the rules laid down in the Digital Markets Act. This centralised enforcement matches the inherently cross-border activities of the gatekeepers and the objective of the DMA to establish a harmonised framework with maximum legal certainty for businesses across the entirety of the European Union. At the same time, as a part of the supervisory architecture of the Digital Markets Act, the Commission will cooperate and coordinate closely with competition authorities and courts in the EU Member States. The final agreement also envisages that where such competence is provided under the national law, the relevant national authorities may conduct investigatory steps in view of determining non-compliance of the gatekeeper with the Digital Markets Act and report about their findings to the Commission. This leverages the strength and expertise of the relevant authorities across the European Union and will ensure a maximum level of compliance.\", \"Will private damages be available to those harmed by gatekeeper conduct?\": \"The DMA is a Regulation, containing precise obligations and prohibitions for the gatekeepers in scope, which can be enforced directly in national courts. This will facilitate direct actions for damages by those harmed by the conduct of non-complying gatekeepers.\", \"Can the enforcement of existing competition law not tackle these issues?\": \"The DMA complements the enforcement of competition law at EU and national level. The new rules are without prejudice to the implementation of EU competition rules (Articles 101 and 102 TFEU) and to national competition rules regarding unilateral behaviour. Regulation and competition enforcement already coexist in other sectors, such as energy, telecoms or financial services. The DMA addresses unfair practices by gatekeepers that either (i) fall outside the existing EU competition control rules, or, (ii) cannot always be effectively tackled by these rules because of the systemic nature of some behaviours, as well as the ex-post and case-by-case nature of competition law. The DMA will thus minimise the harmful structural effects of these unfair practices ex-ante, without limiting the EU's ability to intervene ex-post via the enforcement of existing EU competition rules.\", \"What is the legal basis for the DMA?\": \"Article 114 TFEU ensures the functioning of the single market and is the relevant legal basis for this initiative. Digital services are by essence of cross-border nature. The new rules will limit regulatory fragmentation for digital services, in particular in relation to gatekeeper platforms, and reduce compliance costs for companies operating in the internal market.\", \"When will the rules become applicable?\": \"Once formally adopted, the Act, which takes the legal form of a Regulation, will enter into force 20 days after publication in the EU Official Journal and will apply six months later. The designated gatekeepers will have a maximum of six months after the designation decision by the Commission to ensure compliance with the obligations laid down in the Digital Markets Act.\", \"When will the Commission designate the first gatekeepers?\": \"The DMA will start to apply six months after it enters into force. Once it starts applying any company that meets the quantitative thresholds for identifying a presumed gatekeeper will have two months to notify those quantitative thresholds to the Commission. The Commission will have 45 working days to adopt a decision designating such company as a gatekeeper for each of its relevant core platform services that meet the quantitative thresholds individually. In limited and exceptional circumstances where the company concerned rebuts the presumption of this gatekeeper status with sufficiently substantiated arguments manifestly putting into question the presumption, the Commission would have five months to assess the matter and to adopt its decision on whether or not to designate the company concerned as a gatekeeper.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_2407\": {\"What is a geographical indication?\": \"A geographical indication (GI) is a sign used to indicate that a product has a specific geographical origin and possesses a certain reputation or qualities due to that place of origin. A GI typically includes the designation of the place of origin. All producer groups from the area which manufacture a given product in a prescribed way can collectively use the GI. Champagne or Prosciutto di Parma (ham) are well-known examples of agricultural GIs, a framework already in place since 1992.\", \"Why is the Commission introducing GI protection at EU level for craft and industrial products?\": \"The EU has specific GI protection for wines, spirit drinks and other agricultural products and foodstuffs. However, there was until now no EU-wide mechanism to protect the qualities attributed to specific local skills and traditions relating to other products like craft and industrial products, such as ceramics, glassware, clothing, lace, jewellery, furniture and knives. Protection of those products is already granted in some Member States. However, different national rules have resulted in varying levels of legal protection across Europe. Craft and industrial products producers who wish to protect a GI throughout the EU have to apply for legal protection Member State by Member State, which is very costly. Moreover, the lack of an EU-wide scheme also prevents EU producers from fully benefiting from protection at international level for their GI products.\", \"Which products fall under the scope of the new regulation?\": \"Once adopted, the Regulation will apply to craft and industrial products such as natural stones, jewellery, textiles, lace, cutlery, glass and porcelain. \\u2018Craft products' are products produced either totally by hand or with the aid of manual tools or including by mechanical means, whenever the direct manual contribution is still the most important component of the finished product. \\u2018Industrial products' are products produced in a standardised way, typically on mass scale and through the use of machines.\", \"What criteria must the name of a product meet in order to claim GI protection?\": \"In order to benefit from GI protection, the product needs to comply with the following eligibility requirements that are focused on the geographically rooted product quality: Originate in a specific place, region or country;Have a quality, reputation or other characteristic that is essentially attributable to its geographical origin; andHave at least one production step taking place in the defined geographical area.\", \"How will the registration process work in practice?\": \"The proposal has been designed to minimise the administrative burden and compliance costs for producers and public authorities, while ensuring equal treatment across the Union. Under the new Regulation, the registration procedure has two levels: First phase: producer groups or producers will send their application to Member States' authorities. Authorities at national level will assess the application, run the national opposition procedure, and, following a positive result of the assessment, submit a Union application to the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO).Second phase: the Office will examine the applications in the second stage of the procedure, running a worldwide opposition procedure and taking a decision to grant or refuse the protection. The Office will also carry out the corresponding procedures for GIs originating in third countries. Once the decision for registration is taken, the Office will record in the Union register, in particular the registered name, class, and country -or countries- of origin of the product. For Member States that do not have a national system to protect GIs, the Regulation includes a derogation from the obligation to designate a national authority to implement the first phase procedure. This is called the \\u201cdirect registration procedure\\u201d. It provides for a registration procedure directly managed by the Office. In those cases, the relevant Member States have the obligation to designate a competent authority for the controls and enforcement and to take the necessary actions to enforce rights under the Regulation. As within the GI system for agricultural products, craft and industrial products producers can advertise the protected GI using the same logo on the product labelling. The EU-level craft and industrial products GI rights replace the national specific GI rights in the EU Member States. There will be no coexistence with national regimes.\", \"Why not use trade mark laws to protect GIs for craft and industrial products?\": \"In contrast to GIs, trade mark protection (for example through EU collective or EU certification marks) does not enable producers of industrial and handicraft products to certify at Union level the link between quality and geographical origin that signals qualities attributed to specific local skills and traditions. Moreover, in contrast to trade mark protection, a specific GI protection system gives incentives to public authorities and producers to establish product specifications. Also, the GI system focuses on integrating regional and local expertise in the application and registration process. It establishes a first stage at Member State level, where national authorities play an initial examination role over local producers' agreed product specifications and GI applications.\", \"What are the benefits of an EU-wide GI protection for producers?\": \"The new protection system ensures fair competition for producers and helps them fight counterfeit products. It strengthens local supply, gives producers incentives to create niche markets, and encourages producers' cooperation amongst themselves and with local authorities. As within the GI system for agricultural products, producers can advertise the protected GI by a logo on the product labelling. At international level, GI protection enables EU producers to seek international protection for their craft and industrial products available in other markets of those third countries which are Parties to the World Intellectual Property Organization (\\u2018WIPO') Geneva Act. It also enables third countries or organisations, Parties to the Geneva Act, to obtain GI protection for their craft and industrial products in the entire EU territory. The Regulation ensures that producers can take full advantage of the opportunities offered by Geneva Act and thus fully benefit from the international framework for the registration and protection of GIs (\\u2018Lisbon system'). It also allows for increased protection for EU craft and industrial products producers in third markets such as China through more ambitious GI provisions in bilateral trade agreements concluded by the EU, which would now also cover craft and industrial products. Thus, craft and industrial products protection is an incentive for investment in innovation to protect and enhance the high quality of protected products, thereby enhancing competitiveness.\", \"What are the benefits of an EU-wide GI protection for consumers?\": \"The GI protection of craft and industrial products provides consumers with reliable information on the place of production, as well as the specific characteristics or reputation, identity, authenticity and quality of these products. Consumers can trust that the GI protection is built on a robust system of verification of the territorial link by the competent authorities, and a system of efficient controls, monitoring and enforcement, implemented in partnership with private operators. Another benefit is the better visibility of the products' geographical origin and production techniques. Consumers attach value to products whose quality is associated with a territorial link. In a 2020 study, the Commission found that information on craft and industrial products is often unclear or ambiguous. The GI protection of craft and industrial products is a useful tool to facilitate better visibility and will thus decrease the consumers' search costs (time spent identifying relevant products in the shops).\", \"What are the benefits of an EU-wide GI protection for regions?\": \"The GI protection raises the visibility of the product and the region and helps to attract tourists, increase jobs and the overall competitiveness of the regions. This is especially significant for rural or less developed regions. In addition, sustainable tourism developed around a craft and industrial products GI asset may also reduce tourism seasonality, as craftsmanship offers have a potential to attract tourism throughout the year. This is particularly relevant in the COVID-19 aftermath. Furthermore, geographically linked products are often made based on local know-how and following local production methods that are rooted in the cultural and social heritage of their home region. GI protection helps to preserve traditional, high-quality products and know-how and the jobs linked to them.\", \"What are the costs of a GI protection registration for the producer and how long does protection last?\": \"In terms of costs, at EU level there are no fees except for the \\u2018direct registration' procedure. However, at national level, Member States may charge fees, like for GIs for wine, spirit drinks and agricultural products. Geographical indications are granted for an unlimited duration period.\", \"How is it ensured that producers comply with the product specification and what is the new self-declaration about?\": \"In order to guarantee the specific characteristics of the GI products, producers will be subject to a control system that verifies compliance with the product specification before the product is put on the market and in the marketplace after the product has been marketed. The new self-declaration procedure offers Member States an alternative to the conventional third-party control procedure already known from the GI protection scheme for agricultural products. The new procedure provides for the possibility for producers to declare their compliance with the product specification to the competent authority by means of a self-declaration which must be renewed every three years. The accuracy of the information contained in the self-declaration will be checked by the competent authority on a random basis, and a deterrent system of fines will be put in place. The aim is to establish a lighter and less costly control procedure more tailored for producers of craft and industrial products.\", \"Does the proposal ensure GI protection on the internet?\": \"The proposal ensures that GI protection applies to both, the offline and online environment including the domain name system. For that purpose, the proposal clarifies the relationship between internet domain names and the protection of geographical indications by imposing conditions under which infringing and abusive domain name registrations can be revoked or transferred. Also, the recognition of geographical indications in Alternative Dispute Resolution Procedures is reinforced. In addition, the proposal establishes at the EUIPO a domain name information and alert system that will enable applicants to prevent and take action against potentially infringing domain name registrations. Finally, the proposal builds a bridge to the upcoming Digital Services Act (DSA) by clarifying that, where this is provided by national law, competent authorities of the Member States will be able to issue orders in line with the DSA to act against illegal content that contravenes protection of geographical indications.\", \"What are the benefits of this proposal for SMEs?\": \"The majority of craft and industrial GI holders are micro, small and medium sized enterprises and the proposal is designed taking into account the specific needs and challenges those companies face. The main benefit of this proposal for micro, small and medium sized enterprises is that they can protect their craft and industrial products in the whole EU, through a simple, two-phase procedure, at a moderate cost, with minimum administrative burden. The proposal also helps companies to internationalise their products. The proposal creates simple procedures to register and manage new GIs, not requiring at any stage of the procedure the involvement of legal representatives, and keeps the administrative burden for micro, small and medium sized enterprises to the minimum. The proposal provides for a fully digitalised EU application and registration procedure, which should also reduce the administrative burden, which is crucial for SMEs. The simplified enforcement regime foreseen in the proposal, including the self-declaration of compliance with the product specification will be beneficial for micro, small and medium sized enterprises.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_2390\": {\"What is the EU Air Safety List?\": \"The EU Air Safety List (ASL) is a list of air carriers that do not fulfil international safety standards. The carriers on the ASL are banned from operating to, in and from the EU (including overflight). Carriers that do not operate to the EU can also be put on the ASL, in order to warn those travelling outside of the EU about safety concerns. If the safety authorities of a third country are not able to fulfil their international safety oversight obligations, all the carriers of that country can be put on the ASL. The ASL, while not popular with the affected countries and carriers, has developed into a strong and internationally recognised tool that helps improve the safety of international aviation. This is the case both for flights to the EU, but also for aviation outside of the EU. The ASL is also seen as a strong preventive tool, because when under scrutiny, countries tend to improve their safety oversight to avoid seeing their air carriers on the list.\", \"Which carriers are currently on the EU Air Safety List?\": \"After the 39th update of the Air Safety List in April 2022, 117 air carriers are banned from EU skies: 90 airlines certified in 15 different States[1], due to a lack of safety oversight by the aviation authorities in these States;21 airlines certified in Russia, as well as 6 individual airlines from other States, based on safety concerns identified: Avior Airlines (Venezuela), Blue Wing Airlines (Suriname), Iran Aseman Airlines (Iran), Iraqi Airways (Iraq), Med-View Airlines (Nigeria) and Air Zimbabwe (Zimbabwe). Two additional airlines are subject to operational restrictions and can only fly to the EU with specific aircraft types: Iran Air (Iran) and Air Koryo (North Korea).\", \"Who is responsible for the updates to the EU Air Safety List?\": \"In updating the list, the Commission is assisted by the EU Air Safety Committee (ASC), which comprises aviation safety experts from all the EU Member States and is chaired by the Commission, with support from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Acting on a proposal by the Commission, the ASC delivers its opinion by qualified majority. The proposed measures are then submitted to the European Parliament and the Council before final adoption by the Commission, and publication in the Official Journal. To date, all decisions taken by the Commission to impose or to lift restrictions have been reached with unanimous support from the ASC members and the European Parliament's Transport Committee.\", \"What is the procedure for updates to the EU Air Safety List?\": \"All EU Member States and EASA are obliged to communicate information that may be relevant for the update of the ASL to the Commission. The Commission and the ASC use a variety of information sources when assessing whether or not international safety standards are respected. These include sources such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the United States Federal Aviation Administration, EASA, SAFA[2] and TCO[3] reports, as well as information gathered by individual EU Member States and the Commission itself. It is important to note that this assessment is made on the basis of international safety standards (and not EU safety standards, which are sometimes more stringent), and notably the standards promulgated by ICAO.\", \"To whom does it apply?\": \"The rules establishing the list of banned carriers apply to all air carriers, irrespective of their nationality \\u2013 EU and non-EU. They apply only to commercial air transport, i.e. to the air transport of passengers and cargo for remuneration or hire. The rules do not apply to private and non-commercial flights (e.g. positioning flights for maintenance purposes).\", \"How often is the list updated and what is the timeframe for this? Is there not a risk that it will quickly become obsolete?\": \"The ASL may be updated whenever the Commission deems it is necessary, or upon request of an EU Member State. The ASC normally meets two or three times every year, as necessary. For emergencies, a specific procedure is in place.\", \"How can an airline be cleared and taken off the list?\": \"If an airline considers that it should be taken off the list because it complies with the relevant safety standards, a request can be sent to the Commission, either directly or through its civil aviation authority. For a ban to be lifted, sufficient evidence must be provided to the EU, to prove that the capacity of the airline and of its oversight authority to implement international safety standards is sufficient. The Commission services will then assess the evidence presented by the airline and/or its oversight authority. If the result of the assessment is positive, the Commission will make a proposal to the ASC. Notwithstanding the case of individual air carriers, if the underlying reason for an air carrier being on the ASL is a poor level of compliance with ICAO standards by its safety oversight authorities, it will require the State to address this before that air carrier can be removed from the list. In practical terms, this involves the air carrier and its State providing written information, attending meetings with the Commission and EU Member States, sometimes being subject to an on-site visit led by the Commission, and taking part in hearings in front of the ASC.\", \"How is an airline added to the list?\": \"If the Commission or an EU Member State acquires and confirms evidence indicating serious safety deficiencies on the part of an airline or its oversight authority anywhere in the world, the list will be updated to include this airline or all the airlines of the country in question.\", \"Does the inclusion of an airline in the EU Air Safety List always mean that it is no longer allowed to fly in Europe?\": \"This is correct. As long as the air carrier is subject to a total ban, neither its aircraft nor its personnel can operate in the European Union's airspace. The airline is included in Annex A of the regulation. Equally, as long as an air carrier is subject to a partial ban, it can operate only with the aircraft stipulated in the Regulation. The airline is included in Annex B of the regulation. Banned airlines can, however, use the aircraft and personnel of other airlines, which are not on the ASL, on the basis of contracts called \\u2018wet-lease agreements'. In this way, passengers and cargo can still be transported when in possession of tickets sold by a banned airline, and if the flight is operated by airlines that fully comply with the safety rules. Furthermore, aircraft used for government or state purposes (e.g. transport of the heads of state and/or government, humanitarian flights), do not fall under the safety requirements of ICAO. Such aircraft are considered to be operating \\u2018state flights' and can fly into the EU even if commercial flights are banned. However, such flights do need special authorisation (\\u2018diplomatic clearance') from all the EU Member States that the state aircraft overflies, as well as from the state of destination. In essence, banned airlines cannot enter the sovereign airspace of any EU Member State, nor fly over their territory while they are banned (totally or partially).\", \"Does the list prevent EU Member States from taking individual safety measures at a national level?\": \"No. The general principle is that whatever measure is considered at national level must also be examined at European Union level. When an air carrier is considered unsafe and therefore banned in one EU Member State, there is an obligation to examine this measure at EU level with a view to applying it throughout the European Union. Nevertheless, even where a ban is not extended to the EU, there is scope for EU Member States to continue to act at national level in certain exceptional cases, particularly in emergencies or in response to a safety issue specifically affecting them.\", \"What are airlines' \\u2018rights of defence'?\": \"Airlines that have been banned, or that are being investigated in view of a potential ban, have the right to express their points of view, submit any documents that they consider appropriate for their defence, and make oral and written presentations to the ASC and the Commission. This means that they can submit comments in writing, add new items to their file, and ask to be heard by the Commission or to attend a hearing before the ASC, which then formulates its opinion based on these proceedings and the materials submitted prior to or during the hearing.\", \"Is the Commission approach a punitive one?\": \"The Commission's sole aim is to improve aviation safety, which is in everyone's interest, and in no way to affect a country's economic or social development. Countries affected can put in place technical assistance measures to help airlines achieve a satisfactory level of aviation safety. While in the past the focus has been to put countries and carriers on the ASL, the Commission is now also working with affected states to help them improve their safety situation with a view to removing them from the ASL once the necessary safety levels have been reached.\", \"How is the public informed about the EU Air Safety List?\": \"The latest version of the list is available to the public online. The Commission also liaises closely with European and international travel agent associations each time that any changes are made to the list so that they are in the best possible position to assist their clients \\u2013 the passengers \\u2013 in making informed decisions on travel arrangements. Moreover, the ASL Regulation also obliges national civil aviation authorities, EASA and airports in the territory of the EU Member States to bring the ASL to the attention of passengers, both via their websites and, where relevant, on their premises.\", \"In what way does the EU Air Safety List provide rights to European travellers?\": \"The ASL Regulation establishes the right of any passenger to know the identity of every airline they fly with throughout their trip. To this effect, the contracting carrier is required to inform passengers of the identity of the operating air carrier or carriers when making a reservation, however the booking is made. The passenger must also be kept informed of any change of operating carrier, either at check-in or, at the latest, when boarding. The Regulation also gives passengers the right to reimbursement or re-routing if a carrier with which a booking has been made is subsequently added to the ASL, resulting in the cancellation of the flight concerned.\", \"In what way does the publication of the EU Air Safety List help European citizens travelling beyond EU territory?\": \"The ASL does not only ban unsafe airlines from operating to, from and within the EU. The list also provides useful information to people wishing to travel outside the European Union, so that they may avoid flying with these airlines if they wish. The list also safeguards the rights of consumers who have bought a trip at a travel agent that includes a flight operated by an airline on the ASL.\", \"Is the addition of Russian airlines to the list an additional sanction on Russia?\": \"No, this is not the case. The operational restrictions imposed in the framework of the EU Air Safety List are based solely on safety considerations. Russian airlines have been added because the FATA has violated several international safety standards in authorising continued flights by certain Russian carriers without a valid Certificate of Airworthiness, and without being able to demonstrate the capacity to discharge its responsibilities under the Chicago Convention and the related standards and recommended practices. Furthermore, the airlines concerned have knowingly engaged in commercial air transport, in breach of relevant international safety standards. All EU Air Safety List decisions are based on facts and on safety considerations only. We do not mix safety with politics. The situation will continue to be closely monitored in the coming weeks and months, and if necessary, further action may be taken.

Immediately responding to this call, the European Commission and the Government of Canada launched a global campaign the very same day to raise funds for the people fleeing the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The campaign is organised in partnership with international advocacy organisation Global Citizen. The campaign culminated in a pledging event, broadcast live on 9 April, convened jointly by President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. In recognition of the Polish people's generosity towards refugees, the pledging event was held in Warsaw, with the participation of Polish President Andrzej Duda. The \\u2018Stand Up for Ukraine' global pledging event and campaign has raised \\u20ac9.1 billion for people fleeing the invasion, inside Ukraine and abroad, including a \\u20ac1 billion pledge from the European Commission. On top of that, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has announced an additional \\u20ac1 billion in loan to cover the needs of the people displaced by the invasion. Out of these \\u20ac10.1 billion in pledges and EBRD funding, \\u20ac1.8 billion are for internally displaced persons and \\u20ac8.3 billion for refugees in frontline EU Member States and countries, like Moldova. The \\u20ac9.1 billion pledge is broken down as follows: \\u20ac4.1 billion are financial contributions and in-kind donations for internally displaced people and refugees pledged by governments, companies and individuals around the world.\\u20ac5 billion are loans and grants from European public financial institutions (the European Investment Bank and the Council of Europe Development Bank).\", \"What is the goal of this campaign?\": \"The \\u2018Stand Up For Ukraine' campaign seeks to mobilise governments, institutions, artists, companies and individuals to raise funding and support the people of Ukraine. In particular: For the more than 4 million people and counting who have already sought shelter in the EU: the funding will be used to cater for their short and medium-term needs in EU Member States and Moldova, from food, housing and medical care to education and employment.For the 6.5 million people, including 2.5 million children, who had to flee their homes but stayed in Ukraine and are now internally displaced: funding and donations will provide them with vital humanitarian care. All EU Member States have been invited to contribute with pledges, as well as G20 countries \\u2013 except Russia \\u2013 and other partner countries, including Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and the Gulf Cooperation Countries.\", \"How much did the European Commission pledge?\": \"The European Commission today pledged an additional \\u20ac1 billion of which: \\u20ac600 million for internally displaced people in Ukraine, via the repurposing of existing funds and humanitarian assistance. It will be channelled via the Ukrainian government, Ukrainian local authorities, UN agencies and NGOs.\\u20ac400 million for Ukrainian refugees in frontline Member States via repurposed and new home affairs funds. This is on top what Member States have announced as part of their contribution to the campaign, notably in terms of cohesion funding.\", \"How will you ensure that the money pledged as part of the campaign will reach the people of Ukraine?\": \"Due diligence for the pledges made by EU Member States and third countries will be done by the European Commission. Global Citizen will handle the pledges made by the private sector and other actors. The due diligence process will focus on: 1) verifying the amount of the pledge, 2) determining amounts intended for refugees and/or internally displaced people and the potential impact 3) following up on the implementation of the donor's commitments.\", \"What kind of other support did you receive?\": \"Pledges took the form of financial contributions as well as in-kind donations, grants and loans. The European Commission has created a system to channel in-kind donations from the private sector to Ukraine, Moldova and neighbouring EU Member States, to help cater for the needs of internally displaced and those who have fled the country. The European Commission will coordinate the delivery of large-scale in-kind donations of vital items such as medicines, vaccines, medical equipment, tents, beds and emergency blankets. \\u20ac4.6 million worth of donations have so far been channelled via this new mechanism, including 100,000 ampoules of chemical antidotes, 300,000 doses of vaccines and 515 ventilators. Companies can keep on making in-kind donations and are invited to contact the European Commission via email: ECHO-private-donations@ec.europa.eu\", \"Where will the money go? How will it be distributed?\": \"Pledges from governments for internally displaced people in Ukraine will be channelled largely through the Ukrainian authorities. Donations from the private sector and individuals for internally displaced people will be channelled mainly through UN agencies such as the UNHCR, WFP, Education Cannot Wait, and more, as well as GlobalGiving. A full list of organisations can be found at www.forukraine.com EU Member States have also announced funding that will go towards meeting the needs of refugees from Ukraine on their territory.\", \"Why didn't you set a target for funding?\": \"A week after Putin's invasion of Ukraine, the UN released a flash appeal for $1.7 billion to support emergency relief for Ukrainian refugees. This target has since been reached but with no end to the conflict in sight, needs are growing exponentially. After a month, more than 4 million people had fled Ukraine and millions more were displaced, in the largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II. It is essential to keep providing additional resources to cater for the needs of internally displaced people in Ukraine and of refugees.\", \"Why did you partner with Global Citizen?\": \"This campaign is based on synergies to make the most of the combined outreach of the European Commission, Government of Canada and Global Citizen, to reach beyond the government level and involve civil society organisations active in Ukraine. The European Commission has had fruitful collaborations with Global Citizen in the past, counting on the organisation's ability to mobilise the support of leaders, philanthropists, civil society and entertainers worldwide. The European Commission notably worked with Global Citizen in the context of the Coronavirus Global Response pledging marathon, which raised billions of funding for universal access to COVID-19 vaccines, tests and treatments. We also collaborated on the Recovery Plan for the World campaign fighting poverty, hunger and climate change.\", \"Who has Global Citizen mobilised this time?\": \"The following artists have already joined the campaign: Abel \\u201cThe Weeknd\\u201d Tesfaye, Adam Durica, Aitana, Alanis Morissette, Alejandro Sanz, Alexandra Stan, Ange\\u0301lique Kidjo, Annie Lennox, Billie Eilish, Billy Joel, Celine Dion, Chris Isaak, Chris Rock, Demi Lovato, Elton John and David Furnish, FINNEAS, Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood, Gloria Steinem, Green Day, Herbert Gro\\u0308nemeyer, Hugh Jackman and Deborra-lee Furness, Igo, Jon Batiste, Jonas Brothers, Juanes, Kacey Musgraves, Katy Perry, Leon Bridges, Luke Combs, Madonna, Miley Cyrus, Mirai, Ozzy Osbourne, Pearl Jam, Pharrell Williams, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Radiohead, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Ryan Tedder, Sarsa, Shaquille O'Neal, Stevie Nicks, Stevie Wonder, Tame Impala, U2, Usher, Vito Bambino,Young Leosia, Adam Lambert, Alex Len of the Sacramento Kings, Arlo Parks, Ashlee SImpson, Au/Ra, Axelle Red, Barenaked Ladies, Bastille, Billy Porter, Bridget Moynahan, Bruce Springsteen, Carole King, Christine and the Queens, Connie Britton, Dave Matthews,  Daymond John, Dora Jar, Dylan Dunlap, Ellen Degeneres, Ellie Goulding, Evan Ross, Fall Out Boy, Gelila Puck, Hozier, Isha Sesay, Jamala, KD Lang, Kesha, Lennon Stella, Little Big, Lola Lennox, Luis Fonsi, MA\\u030aNESKIN, Max Kilman, Metallica, Miyavi, Nicky Jam, Nigel Barker, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Noah Cyrus, Padma Lakshmi, Panic!

The four packages of sanctions have hit hard and limited the Kremlin's political and economic options. We are seeing tangible results. But clearly, in view of events, we need to increase our pressure further. That is why the EU has taken further sanctions today. They are broader and sharper, so that they cut even deeper into the Russian economy. Sanctions are targeted at Putin, the Kremlin and its accomplices. They aim to weaken the Russian government's ability to finance its war of aggression against Ukraine and are calibrated in order to minimise the negative consequences on the Russian population. They are imposing a clear economic and political cost on Russia's political elite, while diminishing its economic base. They are well coordinated with our international partners. In addition, sanctions are designed to maximise the negative impact for the Russian economy while limiting the consequences for EU businesses and citizens. Ensuring an effective and diligent implementation of sanctions is key to prevent circumvention. This is primarily the responsibility of Member States. In this process, the European Commission is fully committed to assisting them and ensuring a consistent implementation across the Union.\", \"Who is responsible for enforcing these sanctions?\": \"Member States are responsible for the implementation of EU sanctions, as well as identifying breaches and imposing penalties. As guardian of the Treaties, the Commission ensures the uniform implementation of EU law and monitors the enforcement of sanctions by Member States. The Commission is increasingly supporting Member States in their application of sanctions. On 17 March, the Commission set up the \\u2018Freeze and Seize' Task Force to ensure EU-level coordination to implement sanctions against listed Russian and Belarussian oligarchs. It will work alongside the newly established 'Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs (REPO)' Task Force, under which the EU operates together with the G7 countries Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as Australia.\", \"How many individuals and entities did you add to the asset freeze list?\": \"The EU has extended the sanctions lists on travel bans and assets freezes, adding dozens of people from politics, the business sector and those engaged in propaganda activities, and more entities from financial, military, industrial and transport sectors. It also includes leading business people, oligarchs and their family members, and military personnel. An additional 217 individuals and 18 entities have been sanctioned. This includes all 179 members of the so-called \\u201cgovernments\\u201d and \\u201cparliaments\\u201d of Donetsk and Luhansk. In total, 1091 individuals and 80 entities have now been sanctioned.\", \"Will you adopt further sanctions?\": \"The Commission and the EEAS are working on additional proposals for possible sanctions, including on oil imports, and are reflecting on some of the ideas presented by Member States, with regards to taxes or specific payment channels, such as an escrow account. Coal ban\", \"What is the impact of the ban on coal?\": \"The ban on import of coal will be hard-hitting for Russia. The EU is Russia's biggest coal trading partner, as the EU represents one fourth of total Russian exports. This will result in around \\u20ac8 billion loss of revenue per year for Russia. There will be a wind-down period of four months for existing contracts.\", \"Will you add oil and gas?\": \"We have adopted unprecedented sanctions against Russia since day one of its unjustified war against Ukraine. We have moved quickly and forcefully. Our sanctions are crippling the Russian economy. The new package adopted today, including on coal and in other essential areas which strengthen compliance with rules, will further limit Putin's ability to finance the aggression against Ukraine. There is always a debate on the how far sanctions should go: the measures are calibrated to affect first and foremost the Russian economy and trigger a change in behaviour, i.e. bring to a halt the aggression against Ukraine. We know some parties want to go further. Sanctions are scalable. We stand ready to adopt further measures as necessary, including on oil imports. Some Member States have announced at national level a ban on some fossil fuel imports. The EU has also announced in its REPower Communication of 8 March a strategy to reduce dependence on Russian fossil fuels as soon as possible, including measures for the short and medium-term. Financial measures\", \"What will today's financial measures do to the Russian economy?\": \"Four Russian banks (VTB, Novikombank, Sovcombank, and Otkritie Bank) are now subject to a full transaction ban, in the form of an asset freeze and a prohibition to provide them with funds and economic resources. These measures will be hard-hitting. These four banks, which are now totally cut off from the markets, represent 23% of market share in the Russian banking sector. EU operators will be prohibited from dealing with them or making any transactions with them. This will further weaken Russia's financial system. This comes in addition to all the previous measures taken, notably extensions of financing bans, sanctions on state-owned companies, banning Russian state-owned companies from EU stock exchanges, decoupling key Russian banks from SWIFT, and banning the rating of Russia and Russian companies by EU credit rating agencies, amongst others. The EU has also prohibited the provision of high-value crypto-asset services to persons and entities in Russia. This will contribute to closing potential loopholes. A prohibition on providing trust services to wealthy Russians, making it more difficult for them to store and manage their wealth in the EU. Transport\", \"Why did you introduce the ban on road transport and access to EU ports?\": \"This ban will drastically limit the options for Russian industry to obtain key goods. It will disrupt road and maritime trade both to and from Russia.\", \"Will the ban on Russian-flagged vessels impact the trade flows of agri-food products?\": \"The purchase, import and transport of agricultural and food products are exempted from the ban on Russian-flagged vessels to access EU ports announced today. This is in line with the Commission's strong international advocacy against export restrictions and bans on food. The Commission is closely monitoring the situation of food security worldwide as both Ukraine and Russia are important suppliers to global markets, especially for cereals and vegetable oils. There is no immediate threat to food security in the EU as the EU is itself a big producer and a net exporter of cereals. The immediate impact rather lies in the increase of costs throughout the food supply chain, the disruption of trade flows from and to Ukraine and Russia, as well as to their impacts on global food security. On 23 March, the Commission presented a range of short-term and long-term measures to enhance global food security and to support farmers and consumers in the EU in light of rising food prices and input costs, such as energy and fertilisers. As Russia is deliberately targeting and destroying food storage locations, food security in war-torn Ukraine is of great concern. We will continue to provide humanitarian aid to alleviate the suffering of Ukrainians by securing their access to basic goods and services, notably food. We will also help them to continue planting and growing cereals and oilseeds, much needed for themselves and for the world and facilitate their exports.\", \"How many ships fly the Russian flag?\": \"Russia has a merchant fleet of 2873 vessels flying its flag. These ships will not be allowed to call at EU ports anymore. Russian-flagged ships that may seek to circumvent sanctions by re-flagging in another jurisdiction also fall within the scope of the ban.\", \"How will the maritime exceptions work in practice?\": \"The ban envisages that the authorities of the Member States could authorise the call of a Russian-flagged vessel for imports of energy, certain metals, medical and pharmaceutical products, agricultural and food products, certain fertilizers, nuclear fuel for civil nuclear capabilities, or for humanitarian purposes. Member States should grant any such authorisations only in a limited and strictly interpreted way. The Member State concerned will need to inform the other Member States and the Commission of any authorisation granted within two weeks of the granted authorisation. The Commission is responsible for monitoring the correct implementation of sanctions rules and will be vigilant on any cases of misuse. The European Maritime Safety Agency could support the enforcement by facilitating exchange of information on vessels.\", \"How will EU port operators know if a Russian-flagged vessel has been reflagged to a flag of convenience?\": \"Every ship worldwide is assigned a unique identification number which is provided on behalf of the International Maritime Organization (the \\u2018IMO number'). The IMO number of the vessel is assigned at the time of its construction and remains the same throughout its servicing. As a result, any attempt to circumvent the sanctions by change of flag could be easily identified by the port authorities through a check of the IMO number of the vessel together with the records on-board the ship. In this regard, under the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), the ships are also obliged to keep on-board the synopsis report which tracks the history of change of flags.\", \"What are the exceptions for road transport?\": \"This ban will not affect mail services and goods in transit between Kaliningrad and Russia. National authorities may also grant derogations for the transport of energy, certain metals, food, and pharmaceutical products, humanitarian purposes, the functioning of diplomatic missions and the re-export of cultural goods on loan in the context of formal cultural cooperation. Import and export bans\", \"Will these import and export bans be enough to put sufficient pressure on Russia?\": \"Today's exports bans are worth \\u20ac10 billion and target areas in which Russia is vulnerable, e.g. quantum computers and advanced semiconductors. This will degrade Russia's technological base and industrial capacity and prospects (beyond purely military) in the medium term. Today's import bans are worth \\u20ac5.5 billion and will cut revenue streams for Russia and its oligarchs, on products from wood to cement, from seafood (e.g. caviar) to liquor (e.g. vodka). In addition, loopholes between Russia and Belarus have been closed as far as possible by mirroring the import bans in place for Belarus, as well as aligning \\u2013 where feasible \\u2013 our restrictions and import bans with those of our partners, notably the UK and the US. Most importantly, we are proposing an import ban on Russian coal, after a four-month wind-down period. This is a huge step given that Russia is a big provider of coal to the EU. The export and import restrictions exclude products primarily intended for consumption and exclude products related to health, pharma, food and agriculture in order not to harm the population. Excluding Russia from public contracts and European money\", \"What are you doing regarding financial support to Russian public bodies?\": \"We are proposing to restrict the award and participation of Russian persons or companies to public procurement in the EU. We are also proposing to restrict financial support to Russian publicly owned or controlled entities under EU, Euratom and Member State programmes. This excludes public or public controlled Russian entities from the participation in ongoing programmes such as Horizon 2020 and future grants. We will also restrict non-financial support such as knowledge transfers.\", \"Why are you excluding all Russian persons and entities from EU public procurement?\": \"We do not want EU taxpayers' money to go to the Russian economy which is currently supporting the war in Ukraine. Our aim is to cut Russian businesses from this additional source of revenue which is not negligible.\", \"How many contracts will be covered by the sanctions on procurement?\": \"All contracts awarded to the targeted entities will be covered. The Commission does not dispose of the precise number of contracts.\", \"What happens to contracts for which the award procedure is already ongoing?\": \"The prohibition to provide financial and non-financial support applies with immediate effect, hence ongoing contracts should be terminated, and further contracts may not be awarded to entities falling under the scope of these sanctions.\", \"How can public authorities know that they have to terminate a contract?\": \"They will have to request the necessary information from their contractors when they have grounds to suspect that a contract may be covered by the sanctions.\", \"Can contracting authorities be held accountable for terminating ongoing contracts?\": \"No, all covered entities must enforce sanctions imposed by the EU and there is a general \\u2018no claims clause' that excludes liability of public entities, which terminate ongoing contracts in compliance with EU sanctions.\", \"Is there a de minimis rule?\": \"All contracts covered by the procurement directives are subject to the restrictions. This covers all contracts above the thresholds published under this link: https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/public-procurement/legal-rules-and-implementation/thresholds_en\", \"How will security of supply be ensured?\": \"The transitionary period ensures that new contracts with alternative suppliers can be in place by the end of this period, enabling a smooth transition. Some contracts may continue subject to an authorisation by the competent authorities where there is no viable alternative.\", \"What does the derogation for the provision of strictly necessary goods or services allow?\": \"This derogation allows for the provision of goods or services that are strictly necessary and that can only be procured from Russian persons or companies. It also concerns goods that cannot be sourced in sufficient quantities from other than Russian persons or companies\", \"What about EU support to Russian students and academics and about exchanges between EU and Russian youth?\": \"The participation of Russian public bodies or related entities in Marie Sk\\u0142odowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) will also be terminated. However, MSCA fellowships and ERC principal investigator grants to Russian individuals will in principle remain possible. At the same time, Russian students, scholars and academic staff will remain eligible for short-term exchanges and Russian students and scholars for degree mobility. Student and staff exchanges towards Russia also remain possible. Russian individuals, youth and civil society organisations can continue to participate in Erasmus+ and the European Solidarity Corps youth actions. A thorough screening against the sanction lists will be conducted in all these cases. Guidance on scrutinising foreign direct investments from Russia and Belarus The Commission also published guidance on 5 April for EU Member States on assessing and preventing threats to EU security and public order from Russian and Belarusian investments. The guidance highlights the increased risk from investments subject to Russian or Belarusian government influence in the context of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It calls for close cooperation between authorities involved in investment screenings and those responsible for the enforcement of sanctions. Member States are called upon to urgently set up comprehensive investment screening mechanisms if they have not done so already. They are also called upon to enforce anti-money laundering rules so as to prevent the misuse of the EU financial system by investors from Russia and Belarus.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_2283\": {\"How did the Commission assess Bulgaria's recovery and resilience plan?\": \"The Commission is assessing the recovery and resilience plans based on eleven criteria set out in the Regulation itself. Notably, the criteria require an assessment of whether: the measures have a lasting impact;the measures address the challenges identified in the country specific recommendations or a significant subset of them;the milestones and targets which allow for monitoring the progress with the reforms and investments are clear and realistic;the plans meet the 37% climate expenditure target and the 20% digital expenditure target;the plans respect the do no significant harm principle;the plans provide an adequate control and audit mechanism and set out the plausibility of the costing information. The Commission has summarised its assessment in the proposal for the Council Implementing Decision. The accompanying staff working document provides detailed documentation on the assessment.\", \"Does the recovery and resilience plan effectively support the green transition?\": \"Bulgaria's plan provides strong support for the green transition with 59% of its total \\u20ac6.3 billion allocation dedicated to the green transition. This substantially exceeds the minimum of 37% required by the RRF Regulation. The plan aims to accelerate the decarbonisation of the energy sector with ambitious reforms, including the adoption of a clear framework for the coal phase-out and binding commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions from power production by 40% by 2025. Investments in the plan aim to triple power generation from renewables by 2026, and accelerate their deployment and that of alternative energy sources, such as green hydrogen and biogas. There is also support for electricity interconnection capacity with Greece and Romania. Moreover, the Bulgarian plan sets ambitious targets for expanded storage capacity for solar and geothermal electricity. Reforms of the road and railways sectors, the promotion of zero-emission vehicles, support for railways, better road safety, intermodal transport and sustainable urban mobility will contribute to more sustainable transport. In the area of biodiversity, dedicated measures aim to protect and restore ecosystems and natural habitats and species.\", \"Does the recovery and resilience plan effectively contribute to the digital transition?\": \"The Bulgarian plan's contribution to the digital transition amounts to 26% of its total allocation of \\u20ac6.3 billion. This exceeds the minimum of 20% required by the RRF Regulation. The plan includes measures covering various dimensions of the digital transformation. It includes significant investments and reforms in digital connectivity to increase the coverage of very high capacity networks in rural and sparsely populated areas, and to create a favourable environment for the deployment of 5G networks and digital infrastructure. The plan also supports the development of e-government and the digitalisation of public administration and the judiciary. This contributes to a lower administrative burden for citizens and businesses and to increasing the quality and effectiveness of public services in areas such as justice, health, agriculture and environment, culture, employment and social protection. The plan also supports the digitalisation of the transport and energy sectors. Investments in the digital transformation of business processes and increased cybersecurity capabilities should contribute to improving the efficiency and productivity of businesses. Increasing the population's level of digital skills is another priority supported by the plan, including through targeted reforms and investments in the education system, such as setting up Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) laboratories in schools, and support for upskilling and reskilling to increase the employability of the workforce.\", \"Does the recovery and resilience plan represent a balanced response to the economic and social situation of Bulgaria?\": \"The Bulgarian plan represents a comprehensive and adequately balanced response to Bulgaria's economic and social situation, thereby contributing appropriately to all six pillars referred to in the RRF Regulation. Beyond its important contribution to the green and digital transitions, the plan presents well-targeted policy actions to promote smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. This includes reforms and investments to improve the business environment, foster innovation and R&D and support SMEs and the cultural and creative sectors. Social cohesion is strengthened through the reform of the minimum income scheme, strengthening the adequacy and coverage of the scheme, and modernising the services of the Employment and Social Assistance agencies, as well as by providing support to the social and solidarity economy. The plan also contains measures for improving education and skills, lifelong learning and vocational training, and for reforming the system of social services, including long-term care. As one of the critical sectors for achieving crisis preparedness and resilience, the health sector represents a dedicated component in the plan. Bulgaria's plan contains measures to modernise hospitals and medical facilities, establish an air ambulance system, construct outpatient care units in remote areas and under-served regions and address shortages of healthcare professionals across the country. The plan also includes measures for the next generation, such as the mandatory inclusion of four-year-olds in pre-school education and investments in educational infrastructures, including STEM laboratories and youth centres.\", \"Do the reforms presented by Bulgaria effectively address a significant part of the country-specific recommendations issued to it in the context of the European Semester?\": \"The Bulgarian plan includes an extensive set of mutually reinforcing reforms and investments that contribute to effectively addressing a significant subset of the economic and social challenges outlined in the country-specific recommendations addressed to Bulgaria by the Council in the European Semester in 2019 and in 2020. These concern notably the areas of decarbonisation, sustainable transport, digital connectivity, healthcare, education and skills, social inclusion, research and innovation, public administration and justice, and business environment. In the social field, the Bulgarian plan includes measures to foster social inclusion, which are expected to improve the adequacy and coverage of the minimum income scheme and move forward with the integration of employment and social services. Other measures addressing the country-specific recommendations focus on skills acquisition \\u2013 digital skills in particular -, improving the labour market relevance of education and lifelong-learning systems and on widening the offer of healthcare services across Bulgaria. Through ambitious support for the decarbonisation of the energy sector, increasing the energy efficiency of the building stock and implementing actions in the areas of sustainable transport and digital infrastructure and services, Bulgaria's plan addresses country-specific recommendations in those areas. Finally, the plan contains far-reaching measures to improve the efficiency of public administration and the justice system, prevent, detect and correct corruption, improve the business environment and improve the research and innovation system.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_2239\": {\"What are industrial emissions and why do we need to act on them?\": \"Industrial emissions are pollutants (such as sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides, ammonium, particulates, methane, mercury and other heavy metals) discharged into air, water and soil from industrial plants, harming human health and the environment. Industrial emissions come from activities like electricity and cement production, waste management and incineration, and the intensive rearing of livestock. This pollution can cause health conditions such as asthma, bronchitis and cancer, high blood pressure, heart attack and stroke. The health costs related to this pollution are measured in billions of euros and hundred of thousands of premature deaths each year. Industrial emissions also harm ecosystems, crops and damage the built environment. This proposal will result in health benefits worth \\u20ac7.3 billion a year. Over 50 000 industrial installations in the EU \\u2013 some 30 000 large industrial plants and around 20 000 large poultry and pig farms \\u2013 are currently covered by the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) and its reporting regulation (European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register, E-PRTR). These installations are responsible for the following EU pollutant emissions to air: around 50% of sulphur oxides (SOx), heavy metals and other harmful substancesaround 40% of greenhouse gasesaround 30% of nitrogen oxides (NOx) & particulate matter (PM10). The current framework has reduced pollution to air by between 40% and 85% over the last 15 years, depending on the pollutant.\", \"Why do the EU rules on industrial emissions need to be modernised?\": \"Following years of experience in implementing this directive, it became necessary to modernise it, streamlining some aspects and updating it in line with the European Green Deal objectives. Large industrials plants and livestock farms still cause over half of Europe's emissions to air caused by human activities. The revised framework aims to accompany the green and circular transformation of the industry over the long term, with significant health and environmental benefits. Innovative processes and techniques will enter the market in the coming decades. The revised rules will promote faster uptake of these emerging technologies, stimulating the adoption of processes that are greener, more efficient and more competitive. Greater data transparency and availability will increase public participation in the permitting process, giving the public greater insights into polluting activities in their immediate surroundings and improving access to justice.\", \"What are the main changes proposed in the revised directive?\": \"Pollution prevention and control will still be based on the \\u2018Best Available Techniques' (BAT) IED permitting process, but the framework will be enhanced by measures to boost effectiveness: Member State permitting authorities will be required to use tighter pollutant emission limit values when revising permits or setting new permit conditions. Currently, about 80% of permits stick to the lowest legally allowed values.The EU framework for preventing and controlling industrial emissions will become more forward-looking and innovative, including through the establishment of an Innovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions.Extending the IED's coverage to additional livestock farming and industrial activities, to keep our regime relevant as our economy evolves: new sectors with significant potential for high resource use or pollution need to also curb environmental damage at source by applying Best Available Techniques.Increased focus on energy, water and material resource efficiency and reuse, as well as promoting the use of safer and less toxic, or non-toxic chemicals in industrial processes.Ensuring that depollution and decarbonisation techniques occur together, where possible, to achieve the best health and environmental outcomes and harness technological and investment synergies. This will contribute to fulfilling the EU's 2030 zero pollution and net zero carbon objectives and the long-term EU's 2050 objectives for climate neutrality.\", \"Which additional industrial and farming sectors will the IED cover, and what will be the benefits?\": \"The new IED targets activities that carry a high risk of causing environmental pollution, and large individual installations that would benefit from the IED's integrated approach to environmental management of resource use and pollution control. The new sectors proposed for IED coverage include especially: -   Extractive industry installations (mines), covering metals, rare earth metals and industrial minerals. Energy minerals, such as coal, and aggregate quarries are excluded. -   \\u2018Giga-factories' for electro-mobility batteries: a growth sector, relevant for the industrial transformation, and complementing the Batteries Regulation, for larger-scale plants. -   Larger-scale cattle farming and additional pig and poultry farms. All cattle, pig and poultry farms with over 150 livestock units (LSU) will fall under the scope of the directive. This will result in an increase in the coverage of intensive cattle, pig and poultry farms to reach a new total of 13% of the EU's largest livestock farms overall, of which cattle farms are included for the first time. These farms, at 185.000 in total, are together responsible for 60% of the EU's livestock emissions of ammonia and 43% of methane. The relevant BAT requirements will take into consideration the nature, size, density and complexity of these livestock installations, including the specificities of pasture-based cattle rearing systems, where animals are only seasonally reared in indoor installations, and the range of environmental impacts they may have. The control of air, soil and water/ groundwater pollution from these farms would ensure that livestock farming has much greater control over methane and ammonia emissions, in particular. This would have the following effects: A coverage increase from the current 18% to 60% of ammonia emissionsA coverage increase from 3% now to 43% for methane emissions. This is expected to yield the following pollution reduction benefits, overall: Reductions in methane emissions of 265kt per year (229 kt annually for cattle, and 36 kt annually for pigs and poultry) Reductions in ammonia emissions of 128 kt per year (50 kt yearly for cattle, and 78 kt p.a. for pigs and poultry). The monetised benefits to human health from reducing methane and ammonia from the total cattle, pig and poultry farms in the revised IED scope have been calculated at over \\u20ac5.5 billion per year, not including the improvement to ecological systems. Industrial plant additions to the scope comprise an additional 1 500 to 1 900 installations. The pollution control gains and the reduction in the use of natural resources are presently too uncertain to predict for these new industrial sectors, but past IED experience has shown that new sectors covered by the IED and BAT could expect overall pollutant reductions to decrease in the range of 35% to 70%. Another important benefit of the IED's Best Available Techniques approach is to level the EU-wide playing field by providing minimum operating standards in permits, which are then subject to monitoring and inspections.\", \"What will the proposal mean for the public, especially those who live close to these large plants?\": \"The proposal will ensure much greater access to information on sites regulated by the directive and give the public more insight into polluting activities in their immediate surroundings. For example, the revised Industrial Emissions Portal regulation will provide data searchable by industrial plant or farm by type of emissions and by location. The public and NGOs will also have greater input into the decision-making processes of whether to grant permits to sites, and under what conditions. This will make the industrial emissions framework fully compliant with the Aarhus Convention. Health benefits from better pollution control, locally, regionally, and nationally and in reducing transboundary pollution will be noticeable. Preserving the quality of soils, groundwater, water and air contributes to a healthier environment, either adjacent to IED installations or in river basins further away. At the same time, it improves human health at work and in local communities. The European Citizens Panel on climate change and environment has adopted clear recommendations in this respect in the framework of the Conference on the Future of Europe. In that context, European citizens have expressed manifest support for the EU to tackle the pollution of water, soil and air and to reduce methane emissions, and they emphasize the responsibilities of the polluters. This is in line with the Eurobarometer survey where more than two-thirds of EU citizens (71%) say they think the EU should propose additional measures to address air quality-related problems in Europe. For the largest proportion of respondents (44%), the most effective way to tackle air quality problems is to apply stricter pollution controls on industrial and energy-production activities. This is the most frequently mentioned measure in 25 Member States.\", \"What are the measures to improve the application of existing IED rules?\": \"The new rules will provide incentives for a higher uptake of Best Available Techniques. This will allow installations to reach emission levels towards the most ambitious end of the allowed pollutant ranges. Under the new rules, operators and Member States' permitting authorities will be required to: Assess the feasibility of applying the most ambitious level of emission reduction within allowed ranges as starting point when revising permits, and when setting emission limits in new permitsCreate a common methodology for allowing derogations in IED permits for industrial operators, and set a 4-year maximum time period for any allowed derogationsIncrease the level of public information regarding all IED permits, finding digital solutions to make this information easily and freely available, enabling comparisons within and between sectors, between regions and Member States. The revisions will also enhance public participation in permitting processes, and access to justice in cases of environmental non-compliance with permits or contravention of judicial or procedural issues, including access to compensation for damage.\", \"How will the IED promote innovation and ensure that technologies are up to date and forward-looking?\": \"The revised IED aims to capture innovative ideas and accelerate their practical application on the ground. A new Innovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions (INCITE) will be set up to scout for emerging techniques worldwide. INCITE will identify and evaluate new processes and techniques and, if they are deemed ready for use at an industrial scale within a short timescale, incorporate them in the Best Available Techniques framework as candidate techniques. In addition, plant operators will be allowed up to two years instead of the current nine months to test emerging techniques within their own installations. During this time they will be allowed temporary derogations from selected IED permit conditions, subject to monitoring from permitting authorities. Frontrunners will also be allowed an additional 2 years to implement new environmentally better techniques (i.e. a total of 6 years) that INCITE has identified as being close to market deployment. To ensure that operators and Member States plan ahead, especially when investing in new technologies, operators will have to produce installation-specific Transformation Plans as part of their environmental management system. These plans will show how each installation will contribute to achieving the EU's 2050 zero pollution ambition, circular economy and decarbonisation aims. Sufficient time will be granted for that - by June 2030 for installations other than livestock farms, and the earliest by 2034 for others.\", \"Will the proposals create additional administrative burden?\": \"The proposals have been designed to minimise administrative burden, especially for livestock farms. The availability of online information and data processing tools hold huge potential, e.g. via e-permitting, remote sensing, using artificial intelligence in plant operation control systems and in improved national and EU-wide checks on IED permits. The Commission will work with the Member States to identify further opportunities to promote and support such practices. A lighter permitting regime will apply both to the 20 000 farms already covered and to the additional 165 000 farms newly brought within its scope, which represent an expanded scope to include the largest 13% of Europe's livestock commercial farms. The lighter permitting regime is proportional to the lower risks farms represent compared to the industrial installations and will apply to the 20 000 farms already covered by the IED and the newly covered livestock farms. While the permit would cost \\u20ac2400/year/farm, it will bring about multiple benefits related to health, the environment and innovation.\", \"How are \\u2018Best Available Techniques' set?\": \"The new rules will preserve the effective mechanism used to date to decide what Best Available Techniques are for the various industrial sectors, known as the Sevilla process. The Sevilla process is a participatory, transparent, science-based information exchange involving all industry, national and European Commission experts, and civil society to set mandatory emission limits of pollutants emitted by large agro-industrial installations. Environmental norms defined through the Sevilla process are published for each industrial sector in the \\u2018Best Available Techniques Reference Documents \\u2013 BREFs'.\", \"How will the proposals help reduce pollution and carbon emissions?\": \"Minimum energy efficiency levels or the use of a binding ceiling on energy intensity will become mandatory, where these are included in the sector-specific, legally-binding BAT conclusions. Energy use will have to be reported to the Industrial Emissions Portal, while energy audits and follow-up actions required by the newly revised Energy Efficiency Directive will be incorporated in the strengthened Environmental Management Systems. In this way, all of these instruments will become more mutually supportive, with reporting and monitoring to ensure that audit recommendations are carried out. Installations already subject to the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) will continue to be included in the ETS. The new IED will in addition cover activities responsible for 15% of the overall EU emissions of greenhouse gas emissions not covered by the ETS. The installation-specific Transformation Plans as part of the Environmental Management System will have depollution and decarbonisation as well as circular economy strategies and techniques in place, helping take Europe closer to its climate and pollution goals for 2030 and 2050.\", \"How will the new rules reap the benefits of the digital transition?\": \"Greater use of digital solutions and accelerated uptake of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence in operating industrial installations can help optimise industrial processes, reduce environmental impacts, incorporate innovative clean techniques, and improve business processes. Online information and data processing tools hold huge potential, e.g. via e-permitting, remote sensing, using artificial intelligence in plant operation control systems and in improved national and EU-wide checks on IED permits. Using these tools could yield major administrative simplifications to the BAT-permitting system and improve its performance. The Commission will work with the Member States to identify further opportunities to promote and support such practices. Moreover, digital solutions enable industrial emissions data to be made available publicly in near real time and to simplify reporting to authorities. The Industrial Emissions Portal will contribute to making data available and to the European Green Deal Dataspace, helped also by the Open Data Directive.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_2167\": {\"Why is a new HR Strategy necessary?\": \"There are a number of immediate and emerging challenges facing the Commission at present, from rapid technological advancement and digital transformation, to changing workplace structures and the climate crisis. The world of work is changing, and the COVID pandemic has only accelerated trends towards flexibility and digitalisation of the workplace. At the same time, the Commission must lead by example, embodying EU values and playing its part in implementing the policy solutions it asks Member States to implement. With its \\u2018Greening the Commission' Communication, for example, this means pledging to be climate-neutral by 2030. When it comes to being fit for the digital age, this means exploiting the latest collaborative IT tools to ensure a joined-up European response to increasingly complex policy challenges, and a top-tier HR IT platform to enable effective HR service delivery in support of the full range of Commission actions. And a more inclusive and diverse Commission ensures its workforce reflects the European society it serves, with a broad range of skills and talents that are used to their full potential.\", \"What are the key priorities?\": \"The Strategy focuses on three priorities (attractiveness, recruitment, career), underpinned by a fourth, cross-cutting priority (processes). The Commission will strengthen its attractiveness as an employer to engage and retain top talent from all Member States, and better reflect the diversity of the European society it serves. This Strategy will boost existing efforts to create an inclusive, sustainable and flexible work environment with family-friendly working conditions and attractive professional development perspectives for all. Through new actions, we will continue to actively promote a working environment that is discrimination-free, inclusive for staff from diverse backgrounds and fully accessible for persons with disabilities. For example: Ensuring full gender equality at all levels of Commission management by 2024,Action on diversity will be reviewed and updated,Improvement of accessibility of the Commission's physical and digital environment,Reinforced anti-harassment rules and a prevention framework will be put in place,Actions will be taken to further improve the attractiveness of specific Commission sites.The Commission will adapt to flexible working, providing support for staff and managers working from both offices and from home.It will reduce its carbon footprint by modernising its policies on buildings, staff business travel, external experts' travel, commuting and IT, and compensate remaining emissions with high quality carbon removals. In close cooperation with the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO), the Commission will introduce modern, faster and more flexible selection and recruitment procedures for internal and external candidates, to align itself with other public and private organisations. With a workforce of more than 32,000 in close to 200 places of employment, the Commission recruits approximately 500 officials a year, as well as around 1,800 temporary or contract agents. The current selection and recruitment model needs to be faster and to evolve to match the Commission's need for a more balanced and flexible workforce. For example, an action plan will be developed with Member States which includes country-specific analyses to understand the reasons for the low representation of some countries, and proposed measures to address this issue. All colleagues will be given targeted support and training to have flexible and rewarding careers. This will stimulate a culture of high-performance and autonomy in the Commission, where individual skills and expertise are used in the most effective way to deliver on priorities. Greater career flexibility will result from increased staff mobility, and smarter and more efficient organisation forms, such as cross-cutting project groups. These have already proven to be efficient and a source of motivation and recognition for colleagues engaged in these new management models. They are also key in helping the Commission to manage temporary peaks in workload and to challenge staff ready to assume new responsibilities. Managers will have the support and tools needed to improve their teams' performance and motivation. Career guidance, mentoring, coaching and headhunting will be reorganised and strengthened. The focus will be on a culture of inclusiveness, trust-based management and accountability. Underpinning these priorities is the fourth, cross-cutting priority: the review and simplification of Human Resources processes. This will be based on the following basic principles: the once-only principle for the provision of data;reducing procedural steps wherever possible;transparency;and simple, user-friendly, accessible and transparent processes. The HR delivery model will be refined in a way that brings maximum value to the Commission. It will be enabled by effective HR technology that is fit for purpose to meet staff expectations and business requirements.\", \"How is this relevant to the outside world?\": \"The Strategy addresses the Commission's need to perform at the highest level in the interest of all Europeans. The vision it presents is of a modern, flexible and values-driven organisation with staff who can more than ever focused on delivering outstanding results for citizens across the EU, on the issues that most concern them. An organisation that leads by example, and is seen to play its part in implementing the policy solutions it asks Member States to implement. More specifically, several aspects of the new HR Strategy are directly relevant to various external constituencies. For example, measures to streamline recruitment procedures and strengthen the attractiveness of the Commission as an employer will be of great interest both to potential candidates, and to Member States concerned by the lack of geographical balance in the Commission workforce. To be a credible actor, the Commission has a key role to play and is determined to be a front runner of the transition towards a climate neutral society. That's why it is making its own environmental contribution, including reaching corporate climate neutrality by 2030. That's why it is taking action to ensure it reflects the same diversity and gender balance of the society it serves. And that's why it is undergoing its own digital transition, implementing more efficient HR services supported by a new HR IT platform. Finally, Commission services do not exist in a vacuum; they are embedded in local communities with their own needs and concerns. Parts of the new HR Strategy are relevant to them too \\u2013 in particular as a contribution to urban development, and measures concerning flexible working, staff commuting, work-related travel, external experts' travel, and the corporate vehicle fleet. Reduced travel and use of greener and more sustainable modes of transport will reduce traffic and pollution. A commitment to the preservation of nature and biodiversity will also impact its building portfolio and close surroundings.\", \"Is the Commission workforce diverse enough and geographically balanced?\": \"The Commission does not apply quotas by nationality, but it does pay particular attention to geographical balance among its staff, as the value of the European civil service lies in its rich cultural and linguistic diversity. To do this, it makes reference to \\u2018guiding rates' \\u2013 the share of staff that adequately reflects a Member State's population. Ideally, no nationality should fall below 80% of its guiding rate. However, several already do and this issue needs to be addressed. In addition, our efforts to reach full gender parity at all management levels that President von der Leyen has pledged by the end of the mandate in 2024 are well underway and we will pursue them further. We have already made considerable achievements in this field. The Commission has the first ever gender-balanced College in its history, and Mid-March 2022 45% of its managers are women. Commission staff should also reflect the society they serve and therefore the Commission will update the diversity action plan in early 2022.\", \"How do you intend to tackle these issues concretely?\": \"To ensure a better geographical balance, an action plan will be developed with Member States with country-specific analyses to understand the reasons for the low representation of some countries, and measures to address these. The Commission will invite the Member States concerned to work with it to develop targeted communication campaigns, and provide guidance and training to their nationals for EU competitions. To ensure more diversity in the Commission workforce, the diversity action plan will be updated in 2022. Commission staff should reflect the society they serve. Work towards full gender balance at all management levels will also continue. More broadly, the overall priorities of the new Strategy \\u2013 strengthening the attractiveness of the Commission as an employer, more modern selection and recruitment procedures, and the offer of more flexible and rewarding careers \\u2013 are also expected to help efforts to redress imbalances in the workforce.\", \"How will recruitment procedures change?\": \"To deal with the challenges in attracting and recruiting highly trained, multilingual and geographically mobile professionals, the current selection and recruitment model needs to be faster and to evolve to match the Commission's need for a more balanced and flexible workforce. EPSO is in the process of redesigning open competitions to reflect a faster, more modern approach to selection. Competitions will progressively move to a 24-language regime to enable equal treatment and ensure even broader outreach in all Member States. The eliminating role of verbal, numerical and abstract reasoning tests will be toned down, giving more weight to tests that assess more relevant skillsets, including - as a matter of principle - relevant EU knowledge. Making these processes faster and more efficient should attract a larger spectrum of candidates. Measures to do this include completing the recent shift to remote testing, and improved planning and monitoring to cut the time between the competition and the publication of the reserve list. Subsequent recruitment will also be streamlined, by issuing an offer letter within 25 days of the recruitment request, for example. There has been a sharp drop in younger staff over recent years, with those aged 39 and younger falling from 36% of staff in 2012 to 20% today. So the Commission will increase efforts to recruit junior profiles in order to better reflect this cohort of society. The pilot Junior Professionals programme \\u2013 which offers temporary agent positions to eligible junior staff and trainees, a mobility and training scheme, and the opportunity to take part in internal competitions to become an official \\u2013 will be made permanent, and eligibility broadened to all new recruits with limited professional experience. To retain talent, provide clearer career perspectives for staff, and enable the Commission to make best use of existing skills and experience, regular internal competitions will be organised, including for non-permanent staff when appropriate. These competitions have already been redesigned for certain grades and this work will continue, adapted to different profiles and grades, so as to select the best candidates while ensuring a fast, flexible and efficient process. Promoting regular internal and external mobility at all levels, improving talent management through strengthened career guidance, mentoring, coaching and headhunting, and bespoke learning packages by profession will also help to retain talent.\", \"Why are you only thinking about greening now?\": \"The work has been ongoing for a number of years. Since 2001, the Commission has developed and implemented the eco management and audit scheme (EMAS) Regulation, which has resulted in the integration of environmental concerns into its day-to-day operations. This has delivered major environmental, organisational and financial benefits over the last 20 years. For example, between obtaining formal EMAS registration in 2005 and 2019, the Commission has reduced energy use in its buildings by 65% and CO2 emissions by 86%.Office paper has been cut by 71%, and water use by 58%.Non-hazardous waste production is down by 38%.Overall, the per capita cost of energy consumption by Commission buildings has been reduced by more than half, representing accumulated savings for the taxpayer of more than \\u20ac100 million. But the ambition to provide an example and become climate-neutral by 2030 - requires a whole new level of action. Given its central place in shaping policies, monitoring their implementation, and the wide range of stakeholders it works with, the Commission has a key role to play. It is determined to set a good example in the transition towards a climate neutral society, working together with other EU, international and national public organisations and private businesses.\", \"How will you achieve your green ambitions?\": \"The Commission will become climate neutral by 2030. It is making its climate neutrality pledge under the European Climate Pact it adopted in 2020, whereby European people, communities and organisations are invited to participate in climate action and foster the EU's goal to become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. The Commission will reach climate neutrality by 2030 by reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 60% compared to 2005, and compensating remaining emissions with carbon removals. It will achieve this reduction through the ambitious but realistic goals set out in the Greening of the Commission Communication. These are based on clear evidence and a thorough analysis, and are accompanied by an action plan with specific measures. The main measures cover four areas. Buildings and workspace represented 43% of Commission emissions in 2019: a new real estate policy in Brussels and further action at other sites will reduce emissions by 30% between 2019 and 2030. In Brussels, measures will include a 50% reduction in the number of buildings managed allowing economies of scale in certain services (with a 25% reduction in overall surface). This is coupled with flexible working/teleworking and a gradual shift to dynamic collaborative workspaces. Improvements will also be made to the environmental performance of the building stock. The Commission will also study, quantify and mitigate the climate impact of teleworking.In Luxembourg, office moves, particularly to the new Jean Monnet II building by 2025, will have a substantial impact, while smaller sites (Ispra, Geel, Petten, Seville, Karlsruhe) will see the renovation of buildings and the construction of new, greener ones.On-site energy productions will be developed through the installation of photovoltaic panels and solar water heating, for example.The New European Bauhaus values will also be reflected when developing the Commission's presence and actions at its site For example, the Commission is already actively engaged in a partnership with the Brussels Region in designing the new European Quarter and the new mobility plans. Staff work-related travel represented 28% of Commission emissions in 2019: by organising smart and intelligent missions and greener modes of travel, emissions should be cut by 50% by 2024. Internal guidelines on work-related travel will be revised, and an IT tool integrated into the work-related travel management system will monitor emissions linked to such travel, making it easier to opt for greener travel and accommodation choices. External experts' travel subsidised by the Commission to attend comitology or expert meetings represented 14% of Commission emissions in 2019. The objective is to reduce these emissions by 50%. The Commission will mirror the efforts made on staff work-related travel using a mix of online, hybrid and in-person meetings, and will monitor emissions. IT infrastructures and assets represented 5% of Commission emissions in 2019. For this strategic area, the Communication maintains a balance between greening actions and an increased use of IT. A reduction of 30% of emissions is expected by 2030. Measures include gradually reducing the number of local data rooms to a maximum of three by the end of 2022, streamlining IT and decommissioning obsolete systems, and reducing the individual digital carbon footprints of staff through awareness-raising campaigns. The Communication also covers staff commuting and the corporate conventional vehicle fleet. And it ensures coherence with other aspects of the European Green Deal: the circular economy, preservation of the ecosystem and biodiversity, and the promotion of fair, healthy, sustainable and good food. Finally, staff will be encouraged to play their part by engaging in various activities and promoting the Communication's actions and objectives through outreach programmes like \\u2018Back to School/Back to University'. Overall, these measures ensure a good balance between environmental performance, and the Commission's legal commitments, its duties to the Member States, and the need to maintain outreach activities with European citizens.\", \"What impact will this have on local communities at the Commission's principal sites?\": \"Local communities have their own needs and concerns, and parts of the new HR Strategy are directly relevant to them too. For example, the reduction in managed buildings (by 50% in Brussels), will create opportunities for greater mixed-use development.Measures concerning flexible working, staff commuting, work-related travel, external experts' travel, and the corporate vehicle fleet (100% zero-emission fleet by 2027) could lead to less work-related travel and the use of greener and more sustainable modes of transport, which will reduce traffic congestion and pollution. For example, the Commission will continue to adapt its infrastructure as a priority, including expanding facilities for staff commuting by bike, and the installation of charging points for electric vehicles.It will maintain its dialogue with local authorities at all sites to increase safe mobility, such as additional safe bike lanes. The future organisation of the Brussels Schuman roundabout is an example of close cooperation with the Brussels authorities to promote soft and greener mobility.The Commission will also increase incentives for staff in Brussels to use sustainable methods of transport, by gradually reducing parking spaces by at least 35% by 2030. It will implement a digital tool to allocate parking spaces. With this smarter monitoring and planning, as well as an increase in telework and use of public transport and other sustainable methods of transport, a reduction of parking spaces by at least 35% is realistic.A commitment to the preservation of nature and biodiversity will also impact Commission sites and their surroundings. It has already launched several nature and biodiversity programmes, particularly at its non-urban locations. For example, Petten is one of the greenest Commission sites, with more than 80% of it left for wildlife. Part of the site is counted as a Natura 2000 \\u2018dry heath' habitat. In Ispra, projects to restore and protect native trees are planned in order to stimulate biodiversity and develop the site's natural heritage. Urban sites are not being neglected. There have been volunteer-led efforts in the Commission and other EU institutions to develop small-scale initiatives, such as herbal or vegetable gardens at some buildings. In Luxembourg, the future Jean Monnet 2 building incorporates areas that promote biodiversity. The Commission is evaluating what more it can do, especially in Brussels, where it has launched a study on the various options for improving biodiversity in its building portfolio and close surroundings.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_2190\": {\"Why is the Commission proposing new rules on fluorinated greenhouse gases and ozone depleting substances?\": \"Fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases) and most ozone depleting substances (ODS) have a global warming potential many times greater than carbon dioxide, so reducing their emissions is necessary to fight climate change and protect the health and well-being of EU citizens. ODS also affect the ozone layer, increasing our exposure to harmful radiation from the sun. The primary objective of the proposals on F-gases and ODS is to further cut emissions of these potent greenhouse gases. The F-gases proposal will help the EU reach its emissions reduction target of at least 55% by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050. Both proposals would also ensure that the EU complies with the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer and the Kigali amendment under this Protocol to phase down hydrofluorocarbons. They would improve implementation, enforcement and monitoring of the current rules and achieve more consistency and clarity in how the rules are applied.\", \"What are F-gases and ODS used for?\": \"Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) represent around 90% of F-gas emissions. Their main use is as refrigerants in refrigerators, freezers, air conditioners and heat pumps; as propellants in asthma sprays and technical aerosol spray cans; in fire extinguishers; and as blowing agents for foams. Emissions of other F-gases such as perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), are also significant. These substances are commonly used in industrial manufacturing processes. SF6 is also used for insulation in electrical transmission (power lines). The few ODS that are still allowed are used in the production of other chemicals, as fire protection agents in special applications such as on board airplanes, and in laboratories for analysis. However, the now obsolete use of ODS as blowing agents in insulation foams is still relevant today as many of these foams are still in place in buildings. As they reach the end of their lifespan over the coming decades, they will be removed which could lead to emissions.\", \"How serious are these greenhouse gas emissions?\": \"F-gas emissions currently account for 2.5% of the EU's total greenhouse gas emissions, and 5% of the emissions covered by national emission targets set out in the EU Effort Sharing Regulation. Unlike other greenhouse gases, F-gas emissions doubled between 1990 and 2014. Emissions started to fall after 2014 when the current EU F-gas regulation started to take effect, resulting in a 6% reduction by 2019. The Regulation was also successful in terms of facilitating the global agreement in 2016 to phase down hydrofluorocarbons under the Montreal Protocol (\\u201cKigali Amendment\\u201d). It has been estimated that the Kigali Amendment alone will prevent up to 0.4 degrees Celsius of global warming by 2100. While the EU is cutting F-gas emissions, globally the picture is still different. F-gases are among the fastest growing greenhouse gases, largely as a result of increasing demand for refrigeration and air-conditioning especially in developing economies. As for ODS, while EU-wide legislation has prevented significant amounts of ODS emissions, and only very few ODS uses are still allowed in the EU, the exempted uses must be controlled tightly to avoid illegal use and backsliding. The focus of the new legislation has therefore shifted from phasing out production and consumption of ODS to maintaining tight control of the few exempted uses, as well as preventing emissions from old products and equipment that still contain ODS.\", \"How does the Commission want to further reduce F-gas and ODS emissions and what are the climate benefits?\": \"Emissions of F-gases and ODS can be prevented by using alternatives where possible, and otherwise by putting measures in place to reduce their leakage and emission during production or use. In the F-gases proposal, an HFC quota system would severely restrict the future supply of HFCs to the EU market, reaching 2.4% of 2015 levels in 2050 when measured in terms of their potential climate impact. The system would give all relevant sectors a strong economic incentive to use climate-friendly alternatives. In addition, in some sectors F-gases would be completely eliminated. The proposal also updates a number of obligations for companies, such as implementing best practices, checking for leaks, keeping records, training service personnel and proper waste treatment. The proposal reinforces the licensing system and labelling obligations to improve the enforcement of trade restrictions. Moreover, the new Regulation would bolster the existing monitoring and verification systems to ensure compliance with the Montreal Protocol and set standards for Member States' penalties to deter the illegal trade of F-gases. For ODS, most production, use and trade is already prohibited. The main purpose of the new proposal is therefore to prevent ODS emissions from formerly legal applications in products and equipment. For instance, it would be mandatory to recover or destroy ODS from some insulation foams during the renovation and demolition of buildings. The additional emissions saved from the review of the F-gas Regulation are 310 million tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) from now until 2050. This corresponds to the total annual greenhouse gas emissions of Spain in 2019. In addition, the ODS Regulation would contribute another 180 million tCO2e of savings from now until by 2050 based on the new foam recovery and destruction obligation. This corresponds to the total annual greenhouse gas emissions of the Netherlands in 2019. These savings are coming on top of significant emission reductions resulting from the existing rules. Both actions will contribute to achieving the goal of the Paris Agreement of keeping temperatures from rising more than 2\\u00b0C by 2100, and ideally keeping them to 1.5\\u00b0C. The reduction in F-gas emissions will help Member States meet their national emissions targets under the EU Effort Sharing Regulation and therefore contribute to reaching the -55% net emission reduction target by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050.\", \"How much will this action cost us?\": \"Action to reduce F-gases under the existing Regulation has been very cost-efficient, averaging at just over 6\\u20ac/tCO2e across all sectors. The Commission has carefully chosen additional measures that will not result in very high costs for any economic sub-sectors. It is therefore ensured that the new measures are affordable and proportionate. The new measures will create upfront costs for end-users, but will also reduce their operational costs in the medium-term due to energy savings. The cost of reducing F-gas and ODS emissions will actually be negative for all sectors combined by 2030, which means end users will generally save money. There are also positive effects expected in terms of innovation, investment and employment in the relevant sectors, especially in the equipment manufacturing sector and its supply industry. The review of the ODS Regulation improves its efficiency, reducing costs for industry and authorities by ending some measures that are no longer needed and by using the potential of digitized custom controls to improve the control of trade requirements. The new obligations on how to treat foam at the end of a product's useful lifecycle will have a relatively low cost.\", \"How will the proposals ensure the EU complies with the Montreal Protocol?\": \"The Montreal Protocol has phased out the use of ODS and has set a phase-down schedule for the consumption and production of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). It was necessary to adjust the EU's own HFC phase-down and reporting obligations in the F-gas Regulation. Specifically, it abolishes certain exemptions and thresholds that do not exist under the Montreal Protocol, includes phase-down steps beyond 2030, and introduces a specific phase-down schedule for production. The EU rules on ODS have always been more ambitious than the Montreal Protocol and the phase-out of ODS in the EU is nearly complete.\", \"How will the proposals improve enforcement?\": \"Both proposals include clearer requirements on what customs authorities need to do when F-gases, ODS and related products and equipment containing them are imported and exported. The new rules also require importers to provide additional information to make automatic customs checks possible. The proposals also include rules on inspections and the seizure of goods. Finally, penalties for infringing the rules will become more standardized across EU Member States, and more dissuasive.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_2182\": {\"What is \\u201cthe Wise Persons Group on Challenges Facing the Customs Union\\u201d?\": \"The Wise Persons Group (WPG) is an independent high-level group, comprised of members from politics, industry, trade and academia. It is headed by the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, European Union and Cooperation of Spain, Arancha Gonza\\u0301lez Laya. The full list of members is available online. The European Commission invited this group to reflect on the challenges facing customs today, examine current rules, procedures and governance and consider how these could be improved. Their recommendations will feed into the customs reform package, which the Commission will present by the end of this year. The WPG prepared its report in full independence, based on terms of references agreed with Member States' customs administrations, focusing on four priority areas: (1) E-commerce, (2) Risk management, (3) Effective management of customs' increasing range of non-financial tasks, (4) Future governance structure.\", \"What challenges is the EU Customs Union facing today?\": \"The WPG concluded that the EU Customs Union needs urgent structural change. In its report, the WPG identifies three root issues: (1) major developments in trade and technology, (2) changing expectations in customs in promoting the European Way of Life, (3) lack of unity in applying customs-related rules and procedures. The last decade has witnessed major changes in trade and technology. The volume of trade has significantly increased, and the nature of trade has changed with the rapid expansion of e-commerce, in the form of millions of small packages to be processed at the EU's borders. Moreover, the role of customs has evolved from simple revenue collection to ensuring that the values EU citizens care about \\u2013 such as sustainability, safety, human rights, health and security concerns \\u2013 are upheld in all customs transactions. This role will be greatly expanded as new environmental and social legislation comes into force, such as a ban on products made by child and forced labour. This situation is also compounded by the lack of uniform implementation of customs measures, different control practices across border entry points, both within and across Member States, differences in control priorities and differences in sanctions for non-compliance. The poor availability and quality of the data submitted to customs and the insufficient level of data-sharing across customs and with other administrations makes it extremely difficult to properly manage financial and non-financial risks at both national and EU level. Moreover, investments in customs capacity are seen as not proportionate to the increasing requirements placed on national authorities.\", \"What has the European Union done so far?\": \"The European Commission launched a Customs Action Plan in 2020 setting out a series of measures to make EU customs smarter, more innovative and more efficient. Many of the actions have already been implemented, including a new financial instrument to provide Member States with state-of-the-art customs control equipment to carry out better and more effective controls. Moreover, the Customs \\u2018Single Window' will allow legitimate businesses to complete border formalities in one single portal, saving them both time and money. In addition, Member States are currently engaged in an IT transition following the 2019 amendment of the Union Customs Code, which will be concluded by 2025. However, although these reforms have led to positive improvements, they are not sufficient to ensure that customs are ready to take on the challenges of the 21st century, and adapt to the many and increasing roles they must now fulfil.\", \"What did the WPG suggest?\": \"The WPG believes that the EU Customs Union needs urgent structural change. Their recommendations aim to ensure that the Customs Union is fit for a more geopolitical world in which revenue is secured, trade is made easy, fair, sustainable and safe, and citizens are protected against security risks. The WPG is therefore advocating the need for: A package of reform proposals, relating to processes, responsibilities, liabilities, and governance of European Customs.A new approach to data that diminishes reliance on customs declarations, focusses on obtaining better quality data from commercial sources, and provides businesses with a single data entry point for customs formalities. A comprehensive framework for cooperation, including data sharing between European Customs, but also with market surveillance authorities, law enforcement bodies and tax authorities, for a comprehensive management of risks at EU level.Setting up a European Customs Agency to complement the role of the Commission and support the work of Member States.Reforming and expanding the Authorised Economic Operator scheme.A new framework of responsibility and trust, in which businesses would seek Authorised Economic Operators status to gain commercial access to the EU market. Small non-commercial consignments would continue to be sent through the usual processes, but without priority and subject to a level of controls that reflects their \\u201cnon-trusted\\u201d status.No more customs duty exemption threshold of \\u20ac150 for e-commerce, together with simplified rates for low value shipments.A package of measures to green EU Customs, to digitalise procedures, ensure that prohibitions and restrictions related to sustainability are properly implemented on imported products, as well as possibly reform the WCO Harmonized System Nomenclature to allow for the proper classification of environmentally friendly products that the EU wants to promote in international trade.Properly resourcing, upskilling and equipping customs, to ensure their full capacity to fulfil their missions.An annual estimate of the Customs Revenue Gap to better manage customs revenue collection.\", \"Does the Commission have to follow the recommendations of the Wise Persons Group?\": \"No, the group has a consultative status. It has prepared its report in full independence and the report does not commit the EU institutions to a particular course of action. However, given the in-depth examination they did and the level of expertise of the WPG, the recommendations and insights in today's report will provide valuable input into the Commission's preparatory work for the reform package it intends to present by the end of the year.\", \"When will the Commission propose the reform of the EU Customs Union, and what will it encompass?\": \"The Commission aims to propose a comprehensive reform of the working and governance of the EU Customs Union before the end of the year. Building on the Union Customs Code evaluation and the WPG recommendations, as well as the European Court of Auditors report on customs controls, this customs reform package will not only revise EU customs legislation but also the governance of the Customs Union. The reform package, which should be implemented by 2030, will envision new, more modern customs rules to ensure the security and integrity of the Single Market, reduce opportunities for fraud, and facilitate legitimate trade. It will also increase synergies within customs, and with other authorities, for better border controls and trade facilitation so that EU Customs act as one. The proposal will also assess whether a new EU customs structure, with appropriate powers and supported under the next multiannual financial framework (MFF), could allow a better and more coordinated operational response to the challenges facing the Customs Union.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_2014\": {\"Why is the Commission proposing an Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation?\": \"In our daily lives we use a variety of products, often without thinking about what their production and consumption means for climate and the environment. Products use up massive amounts of materials, energy and other resources and cause significant environmental impacts throughout their lifecycle, from the extraction of raw materials, to manufacture, transport, use and end of life. Half of global greenhouse gases and 90% of biodiversity loss are caused by extracting and processing primary raw materials. Negative environmental impacts include significant resource depletion, generation of greenhouse gas emissions, and pollution. A recent JRC study demonstrated that global planetary boundaries are close to or are already being surpassed in several impact categories. The EU needs to act now to reverse these trends. The objective of the Commission's Ecodesign proposal is to make sustainable products the norm on the EU market and reduce their overall environmental and climate impacts. The \\u2018take-make-use-dispose' model can be avoided, and much of a product's environmental impacts is determined at the design stage. While there are already some sectorial EU rules to make products greener and more energy efficient, a broader framework for setting harmonised rules on environmental sustainability is needed to accelerate the transition to a climate neutral, resource-efficient and circular economy and fully use the leverage of the EU Single Market, while avoiding its fragmentation. The initiative will have environmental benefits by reducing pollution and resource use. It will have a strategic benefit for the EU by increasing our resource independence, also in the context of the current geopolitical situation. It will strengthen the Single Market, make the EU a standard-setter in sustainability and create economic opportunities for innovation, notably in remanufacturing, recycling and repair. Finally, it will foster job creation in the areas of maintenance, reuse, recycling, refurbishment, repair and second-hand sales. Such activities are estimated to create 30 to 200 times more jobs than landfilling and incineration.\", \"What are the main actions proposed?\": \"The proposal follows the same approach as the current Ecodesign Directive, which has been driving efficiency gains for energy-related products in the EU for over a decade. In 2021 alone, existing Ecodesign requirements saved EU consumers \\u20ac120 billion in energy bills. The new proposal will apply to the broadest possible range of products and will use the successful \\u2018Ecodesign approach' to set product-level requirements that not only promote energy efficiency but also circularity and overall reduction of environmental and climate impacts. Such requirements will be set in product-specific legislation and will include rules to make them more durable, reliable, reusable, upgradable, reparable, easier to maintain and refurbish, and energy and resource efficient. They could also address the substances that inhibit circularity or amount of recycled content products contain, as well as ways to make them easier to remanufacture and recycle. This proposal will also enable information requirements to be set for products to know more about the impacts of the products on our shelves and make more sustainable choices along the whole value chain. Digital Product Passports will be rolled out for all regulated products. The product information can also take the form of \\u2018classes of performance' \\u2013 for instance ranging from \\u2018A to G' - to facilitate comparison between products, possibly displayed in the form of a label. This would work in a manner similar to how the widely recognized EU Energy Label currently works, and be for instance used for a repairability score. The proposal incentivises sustainable products and enables mandatory green public procurement criteria to be set, making use of contracting authorities' economic power. It will ensure that material value is retained, via measures to prevent the destruction of unsold consumer goods, including far-reaching transparency requirements for those choosing to discard unsold goods, and the possibility to ban their destruction for relevant product groups. The new measures will also strengthen market surveillance and enforcement, boost compliance and ensure a level-playing field for all placing products on the EU market. Until the broadened framework is in place, the Commission will continue its work under the existing Ecodesign Directive. The new Ecodesign and Energy Labelling Working Plan for 2022\\u20132024 will include new energy-related products, and update and increase the ambition of those already regulated.\", \"Which are the products covered by the proposal cover?\": \"The proposal will enable rules to be set for any physical good placed on the market, or put into service, including intermediate products. Only a few sectors, such as food, feed, and medicinal products, are exempted. To ensure the right priorities are set in a transparent and inclusive way and ensure involvement of relevant parties, the Commission will launch a public consultation on the categories of products to be selected under the first Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation working plan by the end of 2022. A preliminary assessment by the Commission has identified that product categories such as textiles, furniture, mattresses, tyres, detergents, paints, lubricants, as well as intermediate products like iron, steel and aluminium, have high environmental impact and potential for improvement, and may thus be suitable candidates for the first workplan. To take into account individual characteristics and specificities of products, rules will be set product by product. However, where sufficient commonalities across certain products exist (such as electronic appliances or textiles), rules covering groups of products at a time may be set. Once set, rules will apply equally to all products placed on the EU market, regardless of their origin - produced in the EU or imported.\", \"How will rules for products be laid down?\": \"The proposed regulation sets a framework that will enable product-level rules to be laid down in a second stage, through delegated acts, product by product or for groups of products if appropriate. This builds on the approach proved successful under the current Ecodesign Directive. In all cases, the development of these rules will be underpinned by thorough preparatory processes, including inclusive stakeholder consultation and impact assessment, also as regards affordability for consumers, impacts on competitiveness and administrative burden.\", \"How will the proposal address destruction of unsold consumer goods?\": \"The proposal contains several measures to prevent the destruction of unsold goods destined for consumers. Firstly, it will significantly increase transparency: large businesses that discard unsold products will have to disclose their number per year, the reasons for the discarding and information on the amount of discarded products that they have delivered for preparing for re-use, remanufacturing, recycling, energy recovery and disposal operations in line with the waste hierarchy. They will have to ensure this information is made available, either on a freely accessible website, or via other means. This measure will apply to all concerned economic operators as soon as the regulation enters into force. The proposal explicitly prohibits circumvention techniques, such as a big company selling to small companies (which are normally exempted) to make them destroy products. Secondly, the proposal enables the Commission to ban the destruction of unsold consumers goods outright, where it proves to be a particular problem for specific product categories.\", \"What will the new law mean for manufacturers and companies?\": \"The proposal will support the decoupling of economic growth from resource use and increased transparency across the supply chain. Materials are vital inputs to Europe's industries, typically accounting for more than 40% of the input costs of EU manufacturing companies. Their efficient use is important for competitiveness along all 14 industrial ecosystems. Manufacturing more circular and sustainable products leads to important cost savings and has reputational benefits as products increase in quality, with many companies already adopting this logic. The proposed Regulation will provide a level-playing field for businesses aiming to sell their products on the EU market.  Harmonised rules will ensure that diverging national sustainability requirements do not result in market fragmentation, thereby widening existing markets, reducing compliance costs and administrative burdens for those operating across the EU. In addition, strengthened enforcement will protect compliant business while ensuring the environmental aims are met.\", \"What will the revision mean for consumers?\": \"The proposal provides consumers with access to better information and higher quality products. The costs for manufacturing the products that will be regulated are expected to increase, with possibility that some may be being passed on to consumers. The experience under the current Ecodesign Directive, however, is that increased manufacturing costs are more than offset by financial savings for consumers over the long term. Improved product performance and longer functionality will reduce the need to replace products, and lead to overall cost savings, including through lower energy and resource consumption (for example water for washing machines and dishwashers), better performance, durability, upgradability and reparability, as well as higher value at the end of life. Continuing to set ecodesign rules for energy-related products will lead to continued energy savings \\u2013 especially important given the ongoing hikes in energy prices.\", \"What are Digital Product Passports?\": \"Digital Product Passports are tools that can significantly enhance the end-to-end traceability of a product, complementing information provided in product manuals or labels. It should help consumers make informed choices by improving their access to product information, allow repairers or recyclers to access relevant information, and improve enforcement of legal requirements by authorities. The information to be included in the product passport will be determined when preparing product-specific rules. It may include information such as the environmental footprint of a product, information useful for recycling purposes, the recycled content of a certain material, information about the supply chain, and others. Moreover, access to information will be granted on a \\u2018need-to-know' basis. Different people will have access to different sets of information, based on access rights defined for each product group regulated. It will be based on a decentralised data system, set up and maintained by economic operators.\", \"How will the new Ecodesign/Energy Labelling Working plan 2022-2024 help Europeans face high energy prices or poor product performance?\": \"The existing ecodesign and labelling requirements alone are estimated to have saved Europeans more than \\u20ac120 billion in bills in 2021. The projected energy savings will increase in the coming decade as the existing stock of appliances is gradually replaced by models meeting the EU requirements. The actions outlined in the new working plan will further contribute in various ways: Reviews of current rules will in many cases increase the energy savings or other benefits to be expected: upcoming new rules for products such as space and water heaters and tumble dryers will strengthen minimum efficiency requirements but also add requirements in areas such as spare part availability.New rules will cover product groups not regulated now, such as smartphones, tablets and photovoltaic solar systems.A set of new product groups such as low temperature emitters, electric vehicle chargers will be assessed.Actions to support effective national Market Surveillance and help manufacturers, importers and retailers comply will ensure that there will be less \\u201clost savings\\u201d due to non-compliance.A web tool helps consumers find efficient alternatives to their existing, old appliances and facilitate green procurement for authorities and businesses.\", \"How does the initiative contribute to the EU's strategic autonomy in terms of critical raw materials and energy use?\": \"Despite significant efforts to improve resource and energy efficiency, the EU faces strategic dependencies for many materials and fossil fuels. As a result, it remains vulnerable to supply shocks, price volatility and the pressures of the longer-term global acceleration in consumption. Several recent events \\u2013 including the COVID-19 crisis and Russia's invasion of Ukraine \\u2013 have brought global supply chain vulnerabilities dramatically to the fore. About 20% (1.53 Gt) of the raw materials we use are imported, including notably high-value metallic minerals, short-lived fossil fuels and critical raw materials that are scarce in Europe. By making materials last longer, ensuring their value is retained for as long as possible and boosting the use of recycled content in products, the proposal will promote decoupling of economic development from natural resource use and reduction of material dependencies \\u2013 thus fostering EU open strategic autonomy and resilience.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_2121\": {\"What is the Construction Products Regulation about?\": \"The Construction Products Regulation aims to ensure that construction products can freely circulate within the Single Market. To achieve this, the Construction Products Regulation lays down harmonised rules for putting construction products on the EU market. The existing harmonised rules focus on how to express the performance of construction products in relation to their essential characteristics like for instance how they react to fire, how they conduct heat or insulate sound. The current legislative framework also provides harmonised rules on the CE marking of these products. This ensures that reliable information is available to professionals, public authorities and consumers, so they can compare the performance of products from different manufacturers in different countries. Member States are responsible for the safety, environmental and energy requirements applicable to buildings and civil engineering works.\", \"Why do we need a revision of the Construction Products Regulation?\": \"The Construction Products Regulation needs to be revised to: Ensure a smooth functioning of the Single Market and free movement of construction products.Address the sustainability performances of construction products.Enable the construction ecosystem's contribution to meeting climate and sustainability goals and embrace the digital transformation, because its competitiveness depends on this.Ensure that harmonised standards contribute to the competitiveness of the ecosystem and reduce market barriers. In particular, while the current rules have guaranteed a harmonised framework for the marketing of construction products in the EU, there are still some aspects that need to be improved. This is particularly so as regards the process in place to elaborate harmonised standards for construction products. Very few harmonised EU standards have been referenced in the EU Official Journal in recent years. The current Regulation is not fit to deliver on broader policy priorities, particularly on the European Green Deal. It is also necessary to accelerate the uptake and deployment of digital technologies.\", \"How will the new revised Regulation contribute to improving the Single Market for construction products?\": \"In order to achieve a well-functioning Single Market for construction products, the proposal presents a series of tools to unlock the technical harmonisation system through better standards; reduce national barriers to trade for products covered by the Regulation and improve enforcement and market surveillance. The proposal will also provide more clarity in the rules through simplification thereby reducing the administrative burden and help to ensure safe construction products.\", \"How will the new revised Regulation improve the standardisation of construction products?\": \"Standardisation activities for construction products are currently facing a standstill. This is the result of various factors, including outdated standardisation requests, an absence of any technical content related to sustainable use of natural resources as well as legal and technical aspects linked to the mandatory character and exhaustiveness of the standards. In line with the EU Strategy on Standardisation, the revised Regulation foresees the possibility for the Commission to intervene in case the standards are lacking quality or are not provided in time for the market. In addition, the Commission will continue its work with Member States, industry and other relevant parties to revise the outdated standardisation requests, the acquis and to make them future proof for state of the art standards. The so-called \\u201cConstruction Products Regulation Acquis Process\\u201d, launched mid-2020, is the forum where the harmonised standards, the European assessment documents and the legal acts of the Commission are being discussed and shaped, together with Member States, industry and other relevant parties.\", \"What is the link between Construction Product Regulation and the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation?\": \"The objective of the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation is to make sustainable products the norm on the EU market and reduce their environmental impact throughout the value chain. The \\u2018take-make-use-dispose' model can be avoided, and much of a product's environmental impacts is determined at the design stage. The initiative will have environmental benefits by reducing pollution and resource use. It will have a strategic benefit for the EU by increasing our resource independence, also in the context of the current geopolitical situation. It will strengthen the Single Market and create economic opportunities for innovation, notably in remanufacturing, recycling and repair. Harmonised rules are needed to avoid fragmentation of the EU Single Market. The Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation therefore sets a general framework, and more fine-tuned rules will apply to respond to the specificity of products or categories of products. Following this approach, the revised Construction Products Regulation will intervene, in addition to safety and functionality aspects, to set sustainability criteria for construction products. This also necessary because the Construction Products Regulation needs to work in coordination with the national regulatory building codes applicable to construction works. However, specific circumstances may justify targeted intervention on construction products under the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation. This will be the case for example for intermediate products (except for cement) and energy related construction products, which are already regulated under the existing Ecodesign Directive (the case for instance for heaters, boilers, heat pumps, water and space heating appliances, fans, cooling and ventilating systems and photovoltaic products).\", \"What will the revised CPR mean for construction products in terms of sustainability?\": \"According to the proposed Regulation, the manufacturers will have to deliver environmental information about the life-cycle of their products. Moreover, they will have to comply with several obligations, including: Design and manufacture a product and their packaging in such a way that their overall environmental sustainability reaches the state of the art level;Give preference to recyclable materials and materials gained from recycling;Respect the minimum recycled content obligations and other limit values regarding aspects of environmental sustainability;Make available, in product databases, instructions for use and repair of the products;Design products in such a way that re-use, remanufacturing and recycling are facilitated.\", \"How can a manufacturer prove that the product meets all EU requirements?\": \"To prove that products meet the EU requirements, the manufacturer shall draw up a declaration of performance and a declaration of conformity and affix the CE marking. The manufacturer shall draw up a technical documentation describing the intended use and all the elements necessary to demonstrate performance and conformity. This technical documentation shall include the mandatory or facultative calculation of environmental sustainability assessed in accordance with harmonised technical specifications, except in case of used, remanufactured or surplus products.\", \"How are the needs of businesses, SMEs and micro-enterprises covered in the revised Regulation?\": \"The revised Regulation will improve the Single Market for construction products and enhance the circulation of construction products within the EU. The proposal will minimise the compliance costs, notably by a better performing standardisation process, providing clearer provisions, by incentivising the reuse of products, by less additional national requirements and by creating a level playing field for all manufacturers, especially SMEs, in all Member States. Moreover, the intended planned work sharing and the technical fine-tuning with the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation will avoid unnecessary costs for businesses, especially SMEs. The proposal makes maximum use of the potential of digitalisation to reduce administrative burden, considering that the current Construction Products Regulation does not foresee the application of digital tools. All information and documentation may, in the future, be processed in a digital form (e.g. Digital Product Passport) and stored, shared and accessed in an information system. This will lead to greater transparency along supply chains, allow data linked to the Construction Products Regulation to be stored in Building Logbooks and used for calculations required under other legislation (e.g. the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, EPBD). This will also facilitate market surveillance. Additionally, the Member States may exempt micro-enterprises not trading across the borders from certain obligations of the Construction Products Regulation.\", \"What else is the Commission doing to support the greening and digitalisation of the construction ecosystem?\": \"The Commission has been developing a transition pathway for the construction industry ecosystem, in a process of co-creation with industry, interested parties and Member States, as part of the updated Industrial Strategy. As part of this work, the Commission published in December 2021 a Staff Working Document that proposes scenarios for construction to become more green, digital and resilient. An enabling and regulatory framework fit for the future, that fosters investments and the building of trust is key to the ecosystem's resilience and a prerequisite for the twin transitions. In February 2022 the construction sector launched, with the support of the Commission, a skills partnership under the Pact for Skills. The partnership aims to upskill and reskill at least 25% of the construction industry's workforce in the next five years, which corresponds to three million workers. The Commission is also supporting research and innovation into green and digital construction via the Horizon Europe programme. This includes funding in areas such as waste management, digital building permits and logbooks, and a sustainable built environment under the Built4People co-programmed partnership.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_2015\": {\"Why do we need to act on textiles?\": \"In clothes and furniture, medical and protective equipment, buildings and vehicles, textiles are the fabric of everyday life.  European consumption of textiles has the fourth highest impact on the environment and climate change, after food, housing and mobility. It is he third sector for higher use of water and land use, and fifth for the use of primary raw materials and greenhouse gas emissions. The average European throws away 11kg of textiles every year. Around the world, a truckload of textiles is landfilled or incinerated every single second. Global textiles production almost doubled between 2000 and 2015, and the consumption of clothing and footwear is expected to increase by 63% by 2030. In parallel with this relentless expansion, negative impacts on resources, water, energy consumption, and the climate continue to grow. The need to address the production and consumption of textiles is now more urgent than ever before. The textile sectors employs over 1.5 million people in over 160 000 companies, with a turnover of \\u20ac162 billion in 2019. Composed essentially of small and medium-size enterprises, the textiles ecosystem needs to be accompanied to foster its post Covid-19 recovery and to strengthen its resilience and increase its attractiveness to a talented and skilled workforce. Europe has always been and should remain home to innovative brands, creativity, know-how and quality textile products. The EU Strategy for Sustainable and Circular Textiles presents a new approach, achieve these objectives in a harmonised manner. The Strategy implements  commitments made under  the European Green Deal, the new Circular Economy Action Plan and the Industrial Strategy, and aims to create a greener, more competitive and more modern sector, more resistant to global shocks.\", \"What are the main actions included in the Strategy?\": \"The Strategy proposes actions for the entire lifecycle of textiles products, while supporting the ecosystem in the green and digital transitions. It addresses the way textiles are designed and consumed, including by looking also at sustainable technological solutions and innovative business models. Some of the measures include: New design requirements for textiles under the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation, setting mandatory minimums for the inclusion of recycled fibers in textiles, making them longer-lasting, and easier to repair and recycle. Under the proposed regulation, sustainable textiles products will become the norm in the EU. The proposal would also ban the destruction of unsold products under certain conditions, including unsold or returned textiles.Clearer information on textiles and a Digital Product Passport based on mandatory information requirements on circularity and other key environmental aspects.Tight controls on greenwashing, with stricter rules to protect consumers and direct links to the upcoming Green Claims Initiative.Action to address the unintentional release of microplastics from textiles. In addition to product design, measures will target manufacturing processes, pre-washing at industrial manufacturing plants, labelling and the promotion of innovative materials.Harmonised EU rules on extended producer responsibility for textiles, and economic incentives to make products more sustainable (\\u201ceco-modulation of fees\\u201d), as part of the revision of the Waste Framework Directive in 2023.Support to research, innovation and investments and to the development of the skills needed for the green and digital transitions.Addressing the challenges related to halting the export of textile waste.The co-creation of a Transition Pathway for the Textiles Ecosystem to establish the way forward and set out concrete step on how to achieve the 2030 goals set by the Textiles Strategy.\", \"How does the Strategy address the issue of fast fashion?\": \"Many of the pressures created by the consumption of textiles can be traced back to fast fashion \\u2013 low cost, low quality apparel produced at great speed, often under poor labour conditions  outside the EU. The Strategy addresses both the demand and the supply side challenges this creates. For producers, mandatory design requirements for textiles and greater reliance on extended producer responsibility schemes will help extend the lifetime of clothing. Through the Transition Pathway, the Commission will engage with stakeholders to scale up resource-efficient manufacturing processes, reuse, repair and other new circular business models in the textiles sector. The strategy encourages Member States to support the reuse and repair sector at national, regional and local level and adopt tax reductions and other favourable taxation measures for the reuse and repair sector. On the consumer side, the Strategy will encourage a shift towards quality, durability, longer use, repair and reuse. Through the European Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform, it will mobilise designers, producers, retailers, advertisers and citizens in re-defining EU fashion.\", \"How does the Strategy tackle microplastics?\": \"Textiles made of synthetic fibres, such as polyester and acrylic, are one of the main sources of unintentional release of microplastics into the environment. These microplastics are shed at different stages of the product's life. The binding design requirements to be introduced under the Ecodesign Regulation for Sustainable Products, and the Commission initiative to address the unintentional release of microplastics in the environment in the second half of 2022, will both consider measures to prevent and reduce the unintentional release of microplastics. These may address product design, improved manufacturing processes, pre-washing at industrial manufacturing plants, labelling and the promotion of innovative materials.\", \"How will the Strategy address the export of textile waste?\": \"The Commission proposal for new EU rules on waste shipments will only allow the export of textile waste to non-OECD countries under certain conditions. Countries must notify the Commission that they wish to import this waste and demonstrate their ability to manage it sustainably. To avoid waste streams being falsely labelled as second-hand goods when exported from the EU, the strategy proposes the development of specific EU-level criteria to distinguish waste properly. The Commission will also work to increase transparency and sustainability in global trade in textile waste and used textiles.\", \"How does the Strategy address the social aspect of the textiles industry?\": \"The strategy brings together environmental and labour concerns to promote greener and fairer value chains across borders. Internationally, as stated in the Communication on Decent Work Worldwide, the Commission will promote decent work conditions in bilateral relations and multilateral fora. It will focus on gender equality in particular, as 75% of global garment workers are women. In addition, through the Better Work Programme, the Commission continues to support third partner countries to improve working conditions and comply with international labour standards. In parallel, the proposal for a Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive introduces a corporate sustainability due diligence duty for very large companies to address negative impacts on human rights and the environment, both in their own operations and in their global value chains. Under the EU Pact for Skills, workers in the textiles sector will be given the tools to upskill, reskill and acquire new skills. This will lead to greater diversity in age and gender in company management. EU funding programmes will continue support the sector and its workers.\", \"How will the EU work with its international partners to promote sustainable textiles worldwide?\": \"Around 73% of the clothing and household textiles consumed in Europe are produced in and imported from countries outside the EU. In 2017, the EU produced 7.4 kg of textiles per person while consuming nearly 26 kg, making it a net importer. In particular, in 2019 the EU was one of the largest global importers of clothing with a combined value of \\u20ac80 billion. This is why, the Strategy promotes international collaboration to reduce negative environmental and social impacts. To promote sustainable textiles, the EU will pursue progress in international groups (G7, G20), in the context of the Global Alliance for Circular Economy and Resource Efficiency and the United Nations Environment Assembly. The Commission will engage with other partners at global, regional and bilateral levels to promote cooperation and initiatives that support sustainable textile value chains and sustainable fashion.\", \"What does the Strategy mean for companies and manufacturers?\": \"The sector will need to integrate circularity principles in its business models, and minimise its environmental footprint. These efforts will open new business opportunities and strengthen the sector's resilience. The Commission will support the sector in this transition, while engaging in a transparent Transition Pathway with textiles economic actors. The Commission is working on a common industrial technology roadmap on circularity, which aims to streamline industrial research and innovation, including on textile recycling. Financial support for the sector's transition will be available under Horizon Europe's European Partnerships, the LIFE programme, and the Digital Europe Programme for the development of skilled experts to support the textiles industry in its digitalisation.\", \"What is the Transition Pathway and how will it work?\": \"The transition pathway will be a long-term plan for the textile ecosystem to successfully achieve the green and digital transitions and for the ecosystem to become more resilient.  It will address the need to embrace innovation and digitalisation, transform the way we produce, use and dispose of textiles and invest in a workforce with the right skills. It will detail key actions to be taken and set targets and commitments. Indicators will be used to assess and monitor performance over time, impacts on the competitiveness of European companies and possible innovation needs and investment gaps. The Commission invites all interested parties and in particular SMEs, public authorities, social partners and research organisations to express their views on how best to realise the transition, while boosting resilience. All those concerned can provide feedback through an online survey and follow up workshops.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_1993\": {\"How did the Commission assess Sweden's recovery and resilience plan?\": \"The Commission is assessing the recovery and resilience plans based on eleven criteria set out in the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) Regulation itself. The 11 criteria require an assessment of whether: the measures have a lasting impact;the measures address the challenges identified in the country specific recommendations or a significant subset of it;the milestones and targets which allow for monitoring the progress with the reforms and investments are clear and realistic;the plans meet the 37% climate expenditure target and the 20% digital expenditure target;the plans respect the do no significant harm principle;the plans provide an adequate control and audit mechanism and set out the plausibility of the costing information. The Commission has summarised its assessment in the proposal for the Council implementing decision. The accompanying staff-working document provides detailed documentation on the assessment.\", \"Does Sweden's recovery and resilience plan effectively support the green transition?\": \"Sweden has set an ambitious target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2045. Substantial reforms and investments are required to put the country on track towards the achievement of this goal. In this context, the Swedish plan (\\u201cRRP\\u201d) provides a strong contribution in moving Sweden towards carbon neutrality by dedicating 44.4% of its total \\u20ac3.3 billion allocation to the green transition. This substantially exceeds the minimum of 37% required by the RRF Regulation. The plan contains investments in research and development to decarbonise emission-intensive industrial sectors, as well as investments in local and regional climate projects aiming to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions, including electric car charging infrastructures and sustainable biofuel production. The RRP also aims to reduce these emissions through investments to improve the energy performance of multi-dwelling buildings and the upgrade of rail infrastructure. Investments in the protection of valuable nature areas, notably forests, will directly support the preservation of biodiversity and natural habitats. These important investments are complemented by a package of ambitious reforms to support the green transition, including an increase of the energy tax, an adjustment of the car benefit tax calculation (to better reflect cars' carbon footprint) and higher renewables shares in fuels used by the transport sector.\", \"Does Sweden's recovery and resilience plan effectively contribute to the digital transition?\": \"The Swedish plan's contribution to the digital transition amounts to 20.5% of its total allocation of \\u20ac3.3 billion. This exceeds the minimum of 20% required by the RRF Regulation. The plan includes measures covering various aspects of the digital transformation. The support for broadband network roll-out will help improve access to high-speed connections in sparsely populated areas. Investments to increase the number of study places in higher vocational education will address the current scarcity of experts in the Information and Communication Technology sector. The Swedish plan also contains investments to scale up the education at universities and other higher education institutions, with a substantive share that will be devoted to programmes to increase digital skills. In addition, the measures in the RRP are expected to contribute to the digital transition in Sweden by supporting the digitalisation of the public administration, including through the development of a joint digital infrastructure. The plan is expected to foster synergies between tackling the green and digital transitions by supporting the application of smart energy systems to increase the energy efficiency of buildings.\", \"Does the recovery and resilience plan represent a balanced response to the economic and social situation of Sweden?\": \"The Swedish plan represents a comprehensive and adequately balanced response to Sweden's economic and social situation, thereby contributing appropriately to all six pillars referred to in the RRF Regulation. To promote smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, the plan provides for measures to improve labour market participation, social and healthcare systems, and research and innovation policy. A high share of investments supporting the green and digital transitions accompanied by reforms is expected to help make Sweden's growth model more sustainable and resilient. Gradual increases in the retirement age further improve the sustainability of the public pension system, expanded vocational training at upper secondary level enhances employability, improving elderly care by upskilling and training of staff working in care centres contribute to social cohesion and the housing shortage is eased by the supply of new rental dwellings with a lower rent.\", \"Do the reforms presented by Sweden effectively address a significant part of the country-specific recommendations issued to it in the context of the European Semester?\": \"The Swedish plan includes an extensive set of mutually reinforcing reforms and investments that contribute to effectively addressing a significant subset of the economic and social challenges outlined in the country-specific recommendations addressed to Sweden by the Council in the European Semester in 2019 and in 2020. These concern notably the areas of healthcare resilience, climate and digital transition, education and skills development, anti-money laundering, as well as improving supply side conditions and mobility in the housing market. In the healthcare area, the Swedish plan includes measures to increase the accessibility and capacity of the healthcare system, in particular through training of elderly care  providers, increasing the number of study places in vocational education and training, with a focus on health and social care, and through introducing a formally recognised title for assistant nurses. The plan contains several targeted reforms and investments to enhance education and skills developments through both increasing the number of training opportunities and study places, focusing on individuals with particular difficulties in the labour market. The plan envisages a reform adjusting age limits in the pension system: several age limits shall be progressively adjusted as of 2023, with the objective of increasing the average pension age and improving further the sustainability of the public pension system by gradual increases in the retirement age reflected in adjustments in the social security and tax systems. As regards the green transition, the Swedish plan includes measures to support the low carbon and energy transitions, and sustainable infrastructure. In particular, the green transition is supported by broad subsidy schemes aimed at speeding up the decarbonisation of the industrial sector and of transport via the promotion of investments in the development and application of innovative technologies for fossil-free solutions. As regards the digital transition, Sweden's plan emphasises the importance of digital infrastructure, with investments aiming at increasing the availability and quality of high-speed broadband access, particularly in sparsely populated areas. The plan also envisages measures to foster digitalisation within the public administration. The plan is expected to reduce the risk of money laundering in the financial system through measures that strengthen effective supervision and enforcement of the anti-money laundering framework. The plan is expected to contribute to addressing the identified macroeconomic imbalances related to the housing market and household debt for which Sweden received a country-specific recommendation. Remaining policy gaps in this area will need to be addressed in future policy-making. These will be monitored by the Commission as part of the processes under the European Semester and Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure.\", \"What are the flagship investment projects included in the plan?\": \"These are some of the key projects included in Sweden's plan: \\u20ac811 million for local and regional climate investments.\\u20ac286 million to support the green transition via the direct electrification and decarbonisation of industrial processes\\u20ac464 million to support the rollout of high-speed broadband networks in particular in rural and sparsely populated areas, fostering economic activities and territorial cohesion, as well as enabling all citizens to participate in the opportunities of the digital transition, independent of their location.\\u20ac123 million for continuous learning and digital skills.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_2004\": {\"Why is the Commission activating crisis measures?\": \"The military aggression of Russia against Ukraine since 24 February 2022 is impacting the whole seafood value chain - fishers, aquaculture farmers, processing and marketing companies - in the European Union. The impact includes the disruption of trade flows of key commodities for the fishery and aquaculture sector from Russia and Ukraine that suddenly aggravated the increase of prices of key inputs such as energy and raw materials. In addition, this crisis is likely to have serious consequences on the supply of grain, vegetable oils and white fish from Ukraine and Russia to the Union, leading to a strong increase in fish feed prices. As a result, part of the Union fleet has ceased fishing, given the and the present impossibility of compensating the increase in input costs. Fishing vessels operating in the Black Sea are also facing the threat of possible military activities, therefore leading to a precautionary suspension of their activity. The combined impact of those cost increases and shortages is also felt by the seafood farming and processing sectors. This is why the Commission believes there is a market disturbance caused by significant cost increases and trade disruptions that requires action in line with the requirements of the European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF) Regulation, and thus a basis to put in place the crisis measures provided for in Article 26 of that regulation.\", \"How will the measures be implemented?\": \"The measures are in the hands of Member States, which have the responsibility to decide whether to use them. If they decide to use them, they will have to include them in the next version of their European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF)  programme submitted to the Commission. The Commission will provide technical guidance to Member States to frame the methodologies for calculating the compensation. The expenditure for the measures is eligible if it concerns costs incurred between 24 February and 31 December 2022. Member States can immediately start implementing the measures. After the approval of their EMFAF programme for 2021-2027 by the Commission, the Member State will have to formally confirm the selection criteria used for granting the aid.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_1966\": {\"How did the Commission assess Portugal's first payment request?\": \"On 25 January, Portugal submitted to the Commission a request for the disbursement of \\u20ac 1.16 billion under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). The request was based on the achievement of the 38 milestones and targets for the first instalment, as outlined in the Council Implementing Decision approving the plan. They cover  reforms in the areas of health, social housing, social services, investment and innovation, qualifications and skills, forestry, the blue economy, bio-economy, renewable gases (including hydrogen), public finances and public administration. Several targets also concern investments in the areas of infrastructure, decarbonisation of industry. enterprises 4.0 and digital education. With their request, the Portuguese authorities provided detailed and comprehensive evidence demonstrating the fulfilment of the 38 milestones and targets. The Commission has thoroughly assessed this information before endorsing the positive preliminary assessment of the payment request.\", \"What are the next steps?\": \"The Commission has now sent the positive preliminary assessment of Portugal's fulfilment of the milestones and targets required for this payment to the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC), asking for its opinion. The EFC's opinion, to be delivered within maximum four weeks, should be taken into account in the Commission's assessment. The Commission will adopt the decision on the disbursement of the financial contribution, in accordance with the examination procedure, through a comitology committee. Following the adoption of this decision by the Commission, the disbursement to Portugal would take place. The amounts disbursed to the Member States will be published in the Recovery and Resilience Scoreboard. The Commission has also shared its positive preliminary assessment with the European Parliament.\", \"How do the milestones and targets achieved by Portugal so far effectively support the green transition?\": \"In this payment request, the green transition is supported by specific reforms, such as the entry into force of a new general waste management regime, the entry into force of the legal framework on compulsory tenure of rural land in forestry areas and the Decree-Law on the establishment of the integrated management system for rural fires. Investments include new dwellings and energy-efficient renovations in the public housing stock in the Azores, as well as the launch of tenders for innovative projects to help decarbonise industries. While in general in this first payment request, most of the investment-related milestones and targets concerned the early stages of those investments, like the launch of calls for projects, two exceptions were targets for the finalisation of new constructions and renovations that required the assessment of detailed evidence provided. There is also a reform setting the condition for the injection of renewable hydrogen and other renewable gases in the national gas transmission and distribution network. Further, a call for innovative projects to produce renewable hydrogen and other renewable gases was launched. Finally, a reform supporting the implementation of the Innovation Agenda for Agriculture 2030 promotes R&I targeted to the needs of the agricultural sector, helping the green transition. Steps are also taken with the entry into force of the revision of the acts strengthening the financing capacity and innovation of the blue economy.\", \"How do the milestones and targets achieved by Portugal so far effectively contribute to the digital transition?\": \"While milestones and targets related to the digital transition are more concentrated in subsequent payment periods, some flagship measures are already included in the first payment request. Crucially, steps were taken to improve the digitalisation of public administration, to support the digitalisation of the education system and to establish Digital Innovation Hubs to promote the digitalisation of companies. An investment was also launched to better help people with disabilities participate in society by providing a set of digital information tools and services.\", \"How do the milestones and targets achieved by Portugal so far contribute to improving Portugal's economic and social situation, and its resilience?\": \"Portugal implemented a number of milestones that are part of important social and economic reforms. These include, among others, the adoption of a national strategy to combat poverty, of a national strategy for the inclusion of persons with disabilities, the simplified social equipment regime that promotes de-institutionalisation by enabling alternative forms of care, the entry into force of a mental health Decree-Law, which shall set out the principles for the organisation of mental health care services, as well as the approval of action plans for disadvantaged communities in Lisbon and Porto. Portugal also implemented reforms to make R&D investment more efficient and effective; to improve academia-business linkages to enhance knowledge flows and technology transfer; and, to strengthen the agricultural sector, inter alia, by tackling the effects of climate change, including mitigation measures and support to other activities, such as, agricultural services and tourism. The reform of cooperation between higher education and public administration and enterprises is expected to foster collaborative arrangements, responding to labour market needs and the twin transition.\", \"Does the achievement of these first milestones and targets contribute to an effective implementation of the plan?\": \"The milestones and targets fulfilled constitute significant steps in the implementation of Portugal's recovery and resilience plan, and of its broader reform agenda, as a number of them contain important legislative steps that pave the way for the reforms and investments that are planned for the later implementation stages of the plan. Beyond those mentioned above, these include steps relating to Portugal's national promotional bank, Banco Portugue\\u0302s de Fomento, which will help to provide capital to viable Portuguese companies. The first payment request also includes a crucial step towards strengthening the quality and sustainability of public finances with the coming into force of a new management contract template that should increase the performance, responsibility and accountability of public managers appointed to the Boards of Directors of state-owned enterprises.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_1964\": {\"What is the Commission doing to ensure food security in Ukraine?\": \"The Commission has proposed an EU Emergency Support Programme of \\u20ac330 million to Ukraine to help alleviate the suffering of Ukrainians caused by the Russian invasion. This support will help to secure access to basic goods and services as well as protection. To support Ukraine's agricultural output, the Commission is working to develop and implement a short and medium term food security strategy to ensure that inputs reach Ukrainian farms where possible, and that transportation and storage facilities are maintained to enable Ukraine to feed its citizens and to eventually regain its export markets. The Commission is also working with the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) on the ground in Western Ukraine to support small farms and secure agricultural production. In addition, on request of the Ukrainian agricultural authorities, the Commission will seek to ensure that access to EU markets is preserved and facilitated in a flexible way both for imports to and exports from Ukrainian markets. The Commission has mobilised the largest ever response of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism to support the Ukrainian people, providing medical aid as well as food items. Furthermore, the EU has signed agreements for \\u20ac93 million initial humanitarian aid, with \\u20ac85 million to Ukraine and \\u20ac8 million to Moldova. The funding will help people inside Ukraine and those who have fled to neighbouring countries by providing food, water, healthcare, shelter, protection and help to cover their basic needs.\", \"What is the situation of global agricultural markets?\": \"The Commission is closely monitoring the situation of food security worldwide as both Ukraine and Russia are important suppliers to global markets especially for cereals and vegetable oils. Ukraine accounts for 10% of the world wheat market, 13% of the barley market, 15% of the maize market, and is the most important player in the market for sunflower oil (over 50% of world trade). As far as Russia is concerned, these figures are respectively 24% (wheat), 14% (barley) and 23% (sunflower oil). North Africa and the Middle East import over 50% of their cereal needs from Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine is also an important supplier of (feed) maize to the European Union and China. While key customers of Ukrainian and Russian wheat reportedly have stocks for some months, price increases are already felt in some countries. For instance, Yemen, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sudan, and Nigeria are important importers, many of them already severely food insecure. There is no immediate threat to food security in the EU as the EU is a big producer and a net exporter of cereals. The immediate impact rather lies in the increase of costs throughout the food supply chain, the disruption of trade flows from and to Ukraine and Russia, as well as to their impacts on global food security. For the EU's neighbourhood in North Africa and the Middle East though, both availability and affordability are at risk in wheat, the basic food staple, but also in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Indeed, price increases will have repercussions on net food importer countries, further pushing up the already rising number of undernourished people globally.\", \"What is the Commission doing to help third countries at risk of food insecurity?\": \"In international fora, the EU has called on its international partners, particularly the FAO and AMIS, to provide timely guidance as food security is a global challenge and most severe consequences are facing many food-importing developing countries. For the period 2021 \\u2013 2024, the EU is pledging at least \\u20ac2.5 billion (\\u20ac1.4 billion for development and \\u20ac1.1 billion for humanitarian aid) for international cooperation with a nutrition objective. The EU will fund development and humanitarian actions in nutrition-relevant sectors including food assistance, agriculture, water, sanitation and hygiene, social protection, health, education, to help improve nutrition outcomes. In the 2021-27 international cooperation programmes the EU will support food systems in about 70 partner countries. In the short term, humanitarian assistance should be stepped up for low-income food-deficit countries as well as countries affected by conflict in North Africa and the Middle East, in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, the EU will continue to strongly advocate, including in international fora, to avoid export restrictions and export bans on food. The track record shows that such restrictions are disastrous, as the 2007-8 crisis amply demonstrated in various parts of the world. WTO coordination will be essential. In the medium term, the EU will continue to support countries in the transformation towards resilient and sustainable agricultural and aquatic food systems. This includes analytical and policy support, elaborated in the context of the follow-up to the 2021 Food Systems Summit and Nutrition for Growth Summit. In this context, the EU will step up its international cooperation on food research and innovation, including playing a leadership role in the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), with particular reference to climate change adaptation and mitigation and sustainable management and protection of natural resources, applying approaches such as agro-ecology, landscape management and agro-forestry, diversification of trade flows and production systems, and reduction of food loss and waste. To increase resilience, importing countries are encouraged to ensure better diversification of sources of food supplies, through a robust bilateral and multilateral trade policy. Moreover, well-functioning global supply chains and logistics are essential for global food security.\", \"What can the Commission do to tackle rising consumer food prices?\": \"The inflation on consumer food prices was already fast going up in several Member States before the Russian invasion of Ukraine owing to high energy and other inputs costs. Now, there is further pressure with the disruption of trade caused by the conflict. The trade in grain, energy and fertilisers is particularly affected, and this is noticeable in rising prices for these commodities. The Commission closely monitors these developments and the extent to which they will be transmitted to consumer food prices. The EU is a net food exporter and the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) maintains sufficient availability of food and reasonable prices for consumers. A well-functioning food supply chain, including a competition framework that takes account of the characteristics of the agricultural sector, and a fluid single market allow for the best allocation of resources between food operators in the EU, leading to the best value for money possible for EU consumers. However the food price increase will impact low-income consumers. The first line of support for these more vulnerable groups are national social protection programmes aided by EU programmes such as the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD), which supports food banks throughout the EU. Rates of Value Added Tax (VAT) on food can also be reduced down to zero to lower food costs to consumers.\", \"How will the \\u20ac500 million be distributed to farmers?\": \"While the market needs to gradually adjust to new circumstances, support is needed for producers in sectors where input costs are rising to unsustainable levels and where products cannot find their normal market outlet. In order to react efficiently and effectively against this threat of a market disturbance, the Commission will distribute national envelopes to Member States so they can support the producers in the EU agricultural sectors affected by market disturbance induced by the war in Ukraine. Member States should design measures which contribute to food security or address market imbalances. The measures should target farmers who are the hardest hit by the crisis. Support under these measures should be prioritise if they engage in one or more of the following activities pursuing these goals: circular economy, nutrient management, efficient use of resources, and environmental and climate friendly production methods. Member States should also ensure that, when farmers are not the direct beneficiaries of the payments of the Union aid, the economic benefit of the Union aid is passed on to them in full. It will be exceptionally possible to complement this EU support up to 200% with national funds. Member States will notify the Commission not later than 30 June 2022 the measures they will take, their intended impact and the criteria for granting the aid.

It amounts to \\u20ac 497.3 million. The Commission will present to the European Parliament and the Council a proposal for a transfer from the reserve to the budget lines financing the support measures. The support measures will apply once the European Parliament and the Council agree to the transfer.\", \"How will the private storage for pigmeat work?\": \"From 25 March onwards, operators will have the possibility to apply for aid to cover part of the storage costs of pigmeat, provided that they keep it out of the market for minimum 2 months up to maximum 5 months. Aid levels vary depending on the cuts put in storage. Applications can be lodged until 29 April.\", \"How can we enhance resilience by reducing dependencies on fertilisers and inputs needed for agricultural production?\": \"The resilience of the EU agri-food sector requires diversified import sources and market outlets through an ambitious bilateral and multilateral trade policy. The EU invests already considerably in research and innovation to substitute energy-intensive inputs, such as synthetic fertilisers, and to accelerate the transition to more sustainable, resilient, and competitive farming systems. Strategies and technologies to produce bio-based alternatives with similar or improved properties from locally sourced residues will be further scaled-up. Progress in plant breeding and precision farming can also reduce the use of inputs, while producing healthier crops and higher yields. Holistic and environmentally sustainable production systems, such as mixed-farming, agroecology, or organic farming, will optimise the nutrient cycles, strengthen the resilience of the agricultural sector and use minimal levels of chemical inputs. Member States are urged to revise their CAP strategic plans with a view to support farmers in adopting practices reducing the use of fertilisers and optimising the efficiency in their applications. This can be done specifically through precision farming, but also organic farming, agro-ecology and more efficient use through advice and training on nutrient management plays an important role. Member States should fully exploit the possibilities of their CAP Strategic Plan in this regard, as well as optimising and reducing use of other inputs such as antibiotics and pesticides and engage in carbon farming.\", \"How can we reduce on dependence on feed imports?\": \"The Farm to Fork Strategy announces actions to foster EU-grown plant proteins, to support the incorporation of alternative feed materials and to facilitate a better use of European feed resources through the use of feed additives. In addition, the ambitious targets in the Farm to Fork Strategy to avoid nutrient losses by reducing fertiliser use by at least 20% by 2030 and to reach at least 25% of EU agricultural land under organic farming by 2030, will favour the development of EU-grown protein plants, which naturally enrich the soil reducing the need for synthetic fertilisers. The future CAP also provides several supportive instruments in this respect, for instance, sectoral operational programmes that Member States may implement in the plant protein sector, eco-schemes that would reward the integration of legumes in rotation plans and coupled income support for protein crops. In the framework of Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe, the EU is investing in research and innovation programme that supports activities in themes such as breeding of protein plants, feeding, sustainable use of resources, alternative proteins for feed and food, and animal health and welfare.\", \"Is the derogation on land lying fallow for crops in line with the Green Deal and the Commission's environmental ambition?\": \"The derogation is a temporary measure for 2022 to alleviate some demand and supply disturbances in short terms for agricultural products. As an emergency measure in claim year 2022, this derogation is allowing production on fallow land for grass and crops for food and feed to enlarge the EU's production capacity. Introducing more biodiversity in the agricultural fields will continue to be an objective for environmental benefit but also for a better resilience and agronomic preservation of agricultural land in medium term perspectives.\", \"How does the Commission's plan for food security and resilience fit with the Farm to Fork strategy?\": \"The war in Ukraine combined with an ongoing commodity price surge brings to the forefront the links between geopolitics, globalisation, climate change and food security. The Farm to Fork Strategy is an important part of our structural, medium term response. The strategy highlights the need for a resilient EU food system, something underlined by the current crisis. Striving for sustainable food systems includes reducing the input dependence of EU agriculture. In this communication, the Commission underlines the need to prioritise actions that increase yields sustainably through both technological as well as agro-ecological innovation. The contribution to the Farm to Fork and the Biodiversity Strategies should not be abandoned or weakened. Stronger environmental and climate sustainability will increase our resilience and is therefore equally important for food security as addressing disturbances in supply of certain crops is in the short term. We were already committed to strengthening our food security framework, as a follow-up to the Commission's food security contingency plan communication. The Commission has convened on 9 March for the first time its new European Food Security Crisis preparedness & response Mechanism (EFSCM) that was put in place recently based on the Contingency plan communication, which was widely supported by the Council. The group has discussed the current situation and possible action needed to ensure food security in Europe and in the world.\", \"Member States submitted their draft CAP Strategic Plans before Russia invaded Ukraine. Will you allow them to revise their draft plans to adapt them to the radically changed context?\": \"The Commission acknowledges that the Ukraine crisis may have consequences on the strategic plans, including the need to modify the initial proposals. In particular, there will be scope to reinforce elements of the plans aiming to strengthen resilience of the sector, reduce energy dependence and expand the sustainable production capacity. After the adoption and publication of the observation letters, the Commission will work closely with Member States to improve the Plans and introduce the necessary changes.\", \"How will the new CAP and strategic plans contribute to increasing food security and resilience?\": \"There is a clear need to strengthen resilience, reduce energy dependence (on synthetic fertilisers and scale up the production of renewable energy) and preserve and expand sustainable production capacity. These are all core elements of sustainable agriculture and reflected in the Farm to Fork approach. This is why the Commission will support activities such as boosting sustainable biogas production and use as well as carbon removals, improving energy efficiency, extending the use of agro ecological practices and precision agriculture, reducing dependence on input and fodder imports through sustainable livestock systems and fostering protein crop production, and spreading through the transfer of knowledge the widest possible application of best practices. The Commission is assessing the Strategic Plans of Member States with these considerations of the sector's economic, environmental and social viability in mind.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_1937\": {\"Why is the Commission proposing a minimum gas storage obligation?\": \"Current EU rules on the security of gas supplies were conceived with exceptionally cold winters or small-scale disruptions of supply in mind. However, they do not sufficiently equip us with measures to deal with today's security of supply risks and gas markets volatility. Gas storage has an important role to play in guaranteeing the EU's security of supply, covering, in a normal winter, 25-30% of gas consumed across the EU. In the winter season that is now coming to an end, we have witnessed unprecedented low levels of storage, resulting from high gas demand worldwide, which could not be met by supply. Gas storage sites owned by some third country operators have been particularly underfilled. Low gas storage levels in addition to the escalation of the armed conflict in Ukraine since February 2022 have contributed to increasing market uncertainty and translated into greater volatility of energy prices. Therefore, the Commission has proposed a minimum storage obligation for EU Member States to reinforce security of gas supply ahead of winter and be better prepared for unexpected and potentially longer-lasting supply difficulties.\", \"How did the Commission decide the 80% target and the intermediate steps?\": \"Member States must ensure that the underground gas storage infrastructures in its territory are filled up to at least 80% of their capacity at Member State level by 1 November 2022, rising to 90% for the following years. The 90% target reflects average historic EU storage filling levels (with an average of 87% in the last few years). This is also the target used by Transmissions System Operators and the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas when they do contingency planning. For the coming winter, the intermediary targets for each Member State are set for August, September and October of 2022. As of 2023, Member States must ensure that intermediary targets for February, May, July and September are fulfilled. Those national trajectories have been defined taking into account the specific technical characteristics, such as injection capacities of each storage site, and aggregated for each Member State.\", \"How will gas storage be ensured for Member States without their own storage capacity?\": \"Having sufficient gas in storage facilities across the EU is a joint responsibility and will benefit everyone. The Commission's proposal aims to ensure that gas storages can be shared across the EU, in a spirit of solidarity. Therefore, Member States without storage facilities are required to ensure that gas is stored in other EU countries by 1 November corresponding to at least 15% of the annual gas consumption of the Member State without storage facilities. As an alternative option, Member States without storage facilities may instead jointly develop a burden-sharing mechanism with one or more Member States with storage facilities, based on risk assessments identifying their needs. Whenever Member States are not interconnected or cross-border transmission is limited, the storage obligation should be reduced accordingly. The EU has a well-developed network of interconnected pipelines, which allows for the sharing of gas resources. Member States will need to take all necessary measures to ensure the use of this existing infrastructure at national and regional level in an efficient way. The proposal also makes clear that no restrictions to cross-border access and use of storage or liquefied natural gas facilities can be imposed.\", \"How will you incentivise operators to fill the storage facilities?\": \"The new Regulation proposes a 100% discount from the capacity-based transmission tariffs at entry and exit points to storage facilities. In addition, Member States will be free to design other measures to incentivise gas storage \\u2013 whether they have storage facilities or not in their territories. As an example, they may provide financial support or compensation to market actors to make sure that the filling targets are reached, if the Member State considers it necessary. Such compensation may constitute State aid, in the sense or article 107(1) of the TFUE and may need to be notified to the Commission accordingly. The REPowerEU Communication of 8 of March has already clarified that the Union law allows Member States to provide such State aid to suppliers under Article 107(3)(c) of the TFEU.\", \"What happens if Member States are not on track, or miss their targets?\": \"It is the responsibility of the Member States to take the necessary measures to reach the filling trajectory and the filling target. To do that, they can impose deterrent sanctions and fines on market participants, as well as financial incentives or compensation. The Commission will play a key role monitoring the filling targets and in ensuring that those are met, reporting to the Gas Coordination Group, which will have an explicit mandate to monitor Member States' performance in the area of gas security of supply. The Commission will regularly check intermediary targets throughout the filling period. If there is a major shortfall (more than 2%) from such intermediary targets, the Commission will issue a warning and engage with the Member State concerned, together with the Gas Coordination Group, recommending a series of measures to be taken immediately by the Member State. If, after one month the deviation from the foreseen refilling trajectory still remains, the Commission will adopt a decision, as a measure of last resort, to oblige the Member State to take measures that effectively remove the gap to the trajectory. These measures may include for instance imposing obligations on gas suppliers to store minimum volumes of gas or obligations on storage owners to tender their capacities to other market participants.\", \"How will you ensure that Member States have effective control of their gas storage reserves?\": \"Gas storage facilities are critical infrastructure. Therefore, the Commission proposes storage operators to be certified from a security of supply perspective in order to address essential security interests at Member State, regional or EU level. If the assessment concludes that such risks exist and no other measures to remove these risks can be found, the obligation to divest the storage may become necessary. In such a case, the divestment would happen with fair compensation for the value of the asset. Where appropriate, interim measures could be introduced, to protect the control of the site until the change of ownership.\", \"Will the EU budget pay for gas purchases or for incentives to fill up storage?\": \"No. Member States may provide financial support or compensation to market actors to reach the target, if they wish. Member States providing a compensation will also be free to decide how to finance it. They may choose to finance it through the State budget or through a levy charged together with the network tariff.\", \"When will these measures enter into force?\": \"This Regulation will enter into force following its adoption under the ordinary legislative process, meaning after it is voted on by the European Parliament and Council. The Commission has put forward this proposal as a matter of urgency, and hopes that it will be adopted by the Parliament and Council in an expedited procedure, so as to have an effect already in the second half of this year. Regarding in particular the certification, there are around 160 storage facilities in the EU. In order to prioritise, a first wave of certification will look at the facilities with a size significant enough to play a role for security of supply, i.e. above 3.5 TWh, and which have consistently had low levels of storage at the end of the winter. These storage sites will have to be certified within 100 days of the entry into force of the legislation. The other facilities will be certified in a second wave, within 18 months from the entry into force of this Regulation.

It also provides a set of common requirements for Central Securities Depositories across the EU. It is an essential piece of legislation that ensures the stability and efficiency of the EU's financial system. Central Securities Depositories play a pivotal role in the EU's capital markets. They operate the infrastructure (so-called securities settlement systems) that enables the settlement of securities. Today's review aims to provide more proportionate and effective rules to reduce compliance costs and regulatory burdens for Central Securities Depositories, as well as facilitating their ability to offer a broader range of services cross-border, and improving their cross-border supervision. It is a key element of the 2020 Capital Markets Union Action Plan, which aims to boost the EU's capital markets, and ensure that businesses  have access to varied sources of funding. More efficient securities settlement will contribute to this goal.\", \"What led the European Commission to make these proposals?\": \"The Commission concluded in its Report of 1 July 2021 that, in broad terms, the Central Securities Depositories Regulation continues to achieve its original objectives to enhance the efficiency of settlement in the EU and the soundness of Central Securities Depositories. Nevertheless, while the volume of settled trades increased since the entry into force of the Central Securities Depositories Regulation, feedback from stakeholders indicate that in several areas, such as passporting, licensing, and supervisory assessments, significant barriers exist. In 2020, the Commission started carrying out an assessment of the current rules, as required by Article 75 of the Central Securities Depositories Regulation. This included a targeted public consultation with more than 90 contributions from a broad range of stakeholders, as well as reports from the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). In addition to this, the Final Report of the High Level Forum on the Capital Markets Union also recommended in 2020 to review the Central Securities Depositories Regulation to strengthen the Central Securities Depositories passport and improve supervisory convergence among national competent authorities. This would enhance the cross-border provision of settlement services in the EU, thereby fostering further competition and cost savings. In the consultation, stakeholders also expressed concerns on the implementation of specific requirements that already apply (i.e. on cross-border provision of services, cooperation between supervisory authorities, access to commercial bank money, the framework for third-country central securities depositories). Concerns were also raised about the proportionality of the settlement discipline regime and its impact on financial stability. On the basis of this feedback, the Commission adopted the Central Securities Depositories Regulation Report recommending to amend the Regulation in these areas to eliminate disproportionate costs and regulatory burdens on market participants and to simplify rules without compromising the safety and stability of the markets. Finally, today's review is also part of the Commission's efforts to ensure that EU legislation delivers results for citizens and businesses effectively and at minimum cost (REFIT).\", \"What are the main proposed amendments to the Central Securities Depositories Regulation?\": \"Ensuring the stability and efficiency of the EU's settlements markets remains the main objective of Central Securities Depositories Regulation. Nevertheless, a number of changes have been proposed today to make these rules even more proportionate and effective. 1. Improving the passporting regime The current passporting process (i.e. the procedure under which a Central Securities Depository authorised in one Member State can provide services in another Member State), requires the host Member State authority to approve the Central Securities Depository's assessment of the measures needed to comply with national laws, as referred to in Article 49(1) of the Central Securities Depositories Regulation. This has made the process burdensome and costly and has in the past caused Central Securities Depositories to stop providing their services cross-border. This is in contrast to other areas of EU financial services legislation where actions required by host Member State authorities is minimal. The Commission's proposal will clarify and simplify the passporting rules, such as by shortening the period to transmit the request to the host supervisor, removing the possibility for the host supervisors to refuse the passport and mandating that only a notification from the home supervisors to the host supervisors is required. This will minimise barriers to cross-border settlement and reduce the administrative burden and compliance costs. 2. Improving cooperation between supervisory authorities Central Securities Depositories are often part of larger groups, including two or more Central Securities Depositories. In this way, Central Securities Depositories may outsource key support functions to other group entities while governance may be established at group level. So far, the supervisory approach to such entities has focused on individual Central Securities Depositories.. Nonetheless, decisions made by the authority of one Central Securities Depository in the group can impact the other financial market infrastructures in the group. While the Central Securities Depositories Regulation requires the establishment of cooperative arrangements between home and host authorities when certain conditions are met and allows for the voluntary establishment of colleges of supervisors, there is evidence that such arrangements have been rarely used. In practice, this means that communication between authorities in different Member States is not standardised. The same Central Securities Depository is likely to be subject to different supervisory arrangements and requirements in the different Member States in which it may operate. This leads to insufficient cooperation between authorities in home and host Member States but also insufficient supervisory convergence, creating further obstacles in the Central Securities Depositor's cross-border operations, hindering the creation of a true single market for settlement. To address these problems, the Commission is today proposing to establish colleges where a Central Securities Depository is passported in other Member States and where it is part of a corporate group comprising two or more Central Securities Depositories authorised in at least two Member States. A college of supervisors is a formal though flexible structure through which supervisors can organise themselves to ensure consistent and convergent supervision, usually in a cross-border context. While colleges would be set up primarily for information-sharing purposes, and the home supervisor would maintain supervisory powers, other authorities participating in the colleges would be taken more into account by the home supervisor. Colleges will ensure that supervisory responsibilities are aligned, the Central Securities Depositories Regulation is applied in a more convergent and coherent manner, and that supervisory arrangements are more effective. 3. Improving banking-type ancillary services A securities trade typically results in an obligation for the seller to deliver securities and a corresponding obligation for the buyer to pay cash. To ensure the payment of cash, a Central Securities Depository should use accounts that are opened with a central bank (i.e. \\u201ccentral bank money\\u201d) when practical and available. When the use of \\u201ccentral bank money\\u201d is not practical or available, a Central Securities Depository may use accounts opened with a credit institution, or accounts opened in their own books if they are authorised to provide banking-type ancillary services under the Central Securities Depositories Regulation (i.e. \\u201ccommercial bank money\\u201d). As access to the central bank of a relevant currency is not always possible, settlement in \\u201ccommercial bank money\\u201d is sometimes the only option available for Central Securities Depositories when they want to settle in currencies other than that of the jurisdiction in which they are authorised. However, the required banking licence is not always an option for them due to the associated costs. Furthermore, due to the conditions attached to the use of accounts opened with credit institutions, Central Securities Depositories have only used this possibility in very limited cases, according to the thresholds set out in the Central Securities Depositories Regulation. To ensure and further develop competitive settlement markets in the EU, the conditions under which a Central Securities Depository may provide banking-type ancillary services have been reviewed: First, it is proposed to amend the threshold under which Central Securities Depositories can provide these services.Second, the range of providers that Central Securities Depositories can use to offer different settlement services will be broadened. Central Securities Depositories that are authorised to provide banking-type ancillary services will also be able to provide these services to those that are not allowed to do so. 4. Improving settlement discipline: \\u201cSettlement efficiency\\u201d measures the rate at which securities transactions settle on the intended settlement date. A capital market with a high level of settlement efficiency (or settlement discipline) is proof of the market and its participants' reliability, thereby reinforcing its attractiveness for new investors who, in turn, will become a source of capital for companies. Since the entry into force of the Central Securities Depositories Regulation in 2014, settlement efficiency in the EU has continued to improve, albeit slowly. It still remains at lower levels than that of other developed capital markets. There are three main elements of settlement discipline: reporting requirements, cash penalties and mandatory buy-ins. The Regulation's settlement discipline regime was intended to enter into force in 2020, but its implementation was delayed twice due to technical issues, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. The reporting of settlement failures and penalties only entered into force on 1 February 2022. Mandatory buy-in requirements were decoupled and their entry into force was suspended. A mandatory buy-in could be a tool in a settlement discipline framework, i.e. to ensure delivery of securities against cash in a securities trade. For example, should a securities delivery fail in the agreed period (usually two business days), a third party (e.g. a neutral buy-in agent) will buy and deliver the securities to the non-failing party (against payment and a penalty). It became clear during the targeted consultation that the rules on mandatory buy-ins could lead to legal uncertainty, increased costs for market participants and financial stability risks, if not well calibrated. Mandatory buy-ins could also lead to reduced liquidity across asset classes or the reduced provision of certain critical market functions, such as market making. In addition, it is possible that cash penalties and reporting could themselves already provide sufficient incentives to market participants to improve settlement efficiency in the EU. The Commission has therefore proposed a two-step approach: The penalties regime applies from 1 February 2022.The Commission can re-introduce mandatory buy-ins by means of an implementing act in certain circumstances, for example, if the rate of settlement failures does not improve. In addition, to further improve the mandatory buy-in regime, refine its scope, as well as make it more proportionate and effective, a pass-on mechanism will be introduced where only the original failing participant in the chain will be made the addressee of the claim. 5. Improving the oversight of third-country Central Securities Depositories Currently, third-country Central Securities Depositories offering notary and central maintenance services have to be recognised by ESMA, after an equivalence decision for the relevant third country has been taken by the Commission. However, due to a grandfathering clause, third-country Central Securities Depositories that provided services in the EU before the entry into force of the Central Securities Depositories Regulation can  continue  doing so without needing to be recognised. In addition, there is little information on the provision of settlement services by third-country providers. To address these issues, an end-date to the grandfathering clause will be introduced and third-country Central Securities Depositories will now have to notify ESMA when they are providing core services in the EU.\", \"Who will benefit from these changes?\": \"Simpler and more proportionate rules will reduce costs for Central Securities Depositories, market participants, investors and issuers, without compromising financial stability. For example, Central Securities Depositories will benefit from a simplified passporting procedure, which will reduce costs when operating across the EU. They will also benefit from more proportional requirements, such as the increased possibility for banking-type ancillary services. This will increase competition between Central Securities Depositories, which investors and issuers will benefit from. Clearer and less burdensome requirements in the area of settlement discipline will also reduce costs for market participants. This ultimately aims to improve businesses' access to finance, thereby directly benefitting the real economy. Finally, better insight into the activities of third-country Central Securities Depositories and better cooperation between EU supervisors, including in the area of passporting, will improve financial stability for all market participants.\", \"When will the changes enter into force?\": \"The proposal will now be submitted to the co-legislators. The changes will enter into force once the European Parliament and the Council have approved them.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_1776\": {\"What has the EU adopted today?\": \"The EU adopted today a fourth package of restrictive measures against Russia in response to its brutal aggression against Ukraine and its people. These sanctions will further ramp up economic pressure on the Kremlin, and undercut its technological base and curtail its ability to finance its invasion of Ukraine. The agreed measures are the following: A full prohibition of any transactions with key Russian State-owned enterprises across different sectors - the Kremlin's military-industrial complex.An EU import ban on those steel products currently under EU safeguard measures, amounting to approximately \\u20ac 3.3 billion in lost export revenue for Russia. Increased import quotas will be distributed to other third countries to compensate.A far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector, with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU.An EU export ban on luxury goods (e.g. luxury cars, jewellery, etc.) to directly hit Russian elites.A ban on the rating of Russia and Russian companies by EU credit rating agencies and the provision of rating services to Russian clients, which would result in them losing even further access to the EU's financial markets.The list of sanctioned persons and entities has been further extended to cover 15 more individuals and 9 more entities. Altogether the list now apply to a total of 877 individuals and 62 entities.The EU, together with other World Trade Organization (WTO) members, agreed today to deny Russian products and services most-favoured-nation treatment in EU markets.\", \"Why are State-owned banks, railways and the maritime shipping register partly excluded from the prohibition on transactions?\": \"When imposing specific sanctions, the EU selects the most appropriate and targeted measures to achieve the goals pursued by the sanctions regime. It also takes into account possible indirect effects on EU operators complying with the measures. In this case, the EU considered that the measure was most effective by selecting specific transactions with certain State-owned companies. In any event, EU sanctions are scalable and, as the intense activity of the past weeks shows, they are scaled up depending on the situation on the ground.\", \"Will the United States also ban Russian companies from their credit rating agencies?\": \"This EU measure has been coordinated closely with international partners. It is for the United States to announce the exact measure they will be adopting.\", \"What steel products are covered? Are iron products covered?\": \"The list of steel products covered is referred to in Annex 2 of the Amending Regulation, as published in the Official Journal of the EU.  Iron products are not covered.\", \"Why did you not fully ban investment in the Russian energy sector?\": \"The investment ban on the Russian energy sector is far-reaching and comprehensive. Yet, some transactions are needed to ensure the supply of certain energy products into the EU. To ensure close scrutiny, such investments are subject to prior approval from the national competent authorities in the EU.\", \"What luxury goods are covered by the ban? Are there any thresholds? How will they be implemented?\": \"The ban covers a large range of luxury goods, from luxury cars to products for domestic use to watches, to give a few examples. There are different thresholds depending on the category of luxury goods, so that the ban does not hit the more regular needs of the population in Russia. The minimum threshold is \\u20ac300. The ban will be implemented by the EU's customs authorities: banned products are not allowed to be exported to Russia.\", \"Does the ban on luxury goods also cover imports from Russia (such as caviar or vodka)?\": \"No, the focus of this package of sanctions is on depriving Russia from EU luxury goods.\", \"How will the EU avoid the risk of circumvention of banned products via third countries? Will the EU introduce further trade restrictions in the future?\": \"Under the current Regulation, there is already a clear prohibition from circumventing the restrictive measures including via third countries. It constitutes a violation of sanctions.\", \"What are you doing to prevent oligarchs from using crypto assets to circumvent sanctions?\": \"The sanctions package adopted on 9 March 2022 fully clarifies that crypto assets fall under the scope of \\u201ctransferable securities\\u201d. It also confirms the common understanding that loans and credit also include crypto assets. These clarifications will help ensure the proper implementation of the restrictions in place. The circumvention of the restriction on some banks to use SWIFT is theoretically possible via crypto-assets or by other means. However, it is not immediately possible to do so in a timely and efficient manner. Markets are broadly aware of this. At first sight, it might be that the use of crypto to avoid sanctions is more relevant for our restrictions on capital outflows from Russia. While sanctions evasion via crypto currencies is harder to detect in the first place, once detected it is easy to investigate because crypto transactions are fully traceable and it is practically impossible to alter that. If and when large amounts of crypto assets are converted to fiat currencies (and vice versa), these transactions will fall under anti-money laundering due diligence rules. We continue to constantly monitor the market situation. Any indications for non-compliance with the sanctions will be looked at by the relevant authorities in the Member States.\", \"What are the consequences of denying Russia most-favoured-nation (MFN) status?\": \"Removal of MFN status means suspending the benefits that come from being a WTO Member, more specifically the benefit of not being discriminated against by other Members. For example, MFN treatment guarantees that a Member will not be subject to higher tariffs than other Members, or to import bans that do not apply to other Members. Suspension of MFN treatment means that the Member concerned \\u2013 in this case Russia \\u2013 may be subject to higher tariffs and import bans. The EU has decided to act not through an increase on import tariffs, but through set of sanctions that comprise bans on the imports or exports of goods, as this is much quicker and more effective than preparing a completely new tariff schedule from scratch. In practice, the EU has already removed a number of trade benefits that Russia previously enjoyed through the imposition of sanctions. Additionally, the EU has restricted the provision of SWIFT financial services to certain Russian banks, which constitutes a disapplication of MFN vis-a\\u0300-vis Russia under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). Today's sanctions remove further trade benefits from Russia.\", \"President von der Leyen said that Russia's financing by leading multilateral and international financial institutions would be suspended. Which institutions are they?\": \"The institutions consist of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank Group, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). While Russia's membership of these institutions cannot often be suspended as such, the EU is working with its international partners to prevent Russia from obtaining financing from these institutions.  For example, the EU is working with its partners to make sure that the EBRD suspends Russia and Belarus' access to EBRD finance and expertise.\", \"Can you tell us more about the International Task Force that has been set up to coordinate action on sanctions?\": \"As announced by the G7, an International Task Force has started its work on sanctions implementation, for example the enforcement of asset freezes against listed individuals. Within the Commission, Commissioner Reynders leads the \\u201cFreeze and Seize\\u201d Task Force, which coordinates work done at national level by law enforcement authorities, prosecution services and judicial authorities, to identify, freeze and, where possible, confiscate assets of Russian and Belarussian individuals subject to EU sanctions.  The Commission's Task Force seeks coordinated actions between Member States, Eurojust and other agencies, such as Europol and eu-LISA. It works closely with international partners, including the International Task Force.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_1523\": {\"What is the Technical Support Instrument?\": \"The Technical Support Instrument (TSI) is the Commission's instrument to provide technical support to reforms in EU Member States, following requests by national authorities. TSI is part of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027 and of the Recovery Plan for Europe. It promotes the EU's economic, social and territorial cohesion by supporting Member States' efforts to implement the necessary reforms. The TSI builds on the success of its predecessor, the Structural Reform Support Programme (SRSP). Through the SRSP, the Commission has, since 2017, provided technical support to all 27 Member States with more than 1,400 projects in a broad range of policy areas.\", \"How large is the TSI budget and how much funding does each Member State receive?\": \"While the SRSP operated with a budget of \\u20ac222.8 million for the period of 2017-2020, TSI has an increased budget and an extended duration that matches the duration of the MFF (\\u20ac864 million for 7 years, ca. \\u20ac115 million per year). For 2022, TSI has a total budget of \\u20ac116.8 million. The Commission does not provide direct funding to Member States. Rather, it provides expertise to Member States who then are responsible to carry out the reforms. The TSI is demand driven, meaning that it follows a request from Member States. The expertise delivered by the Commission does not require national co-funding but the success of the reform support relies on the engagement and ownership of the Member State authorities. In many cases, the support is given as a mix of external support, combined with the Commission's own expertise (DG REFORM and/or other Commission services) which is deployed specifically for each case in a tailor-made fashion. Finally, while the Commission provides expertise to support Member States with the design and implementation of reforms, the reforms themselves are not funded by the TSI. These can be funded by national means or other EU funds, such as the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF).\", \"What kinds of reforms are eligible under the TSI?\": \"The TSI may support a very broad range of potential reforms, proposed by the Member States. Eligible policy areas for reform support include: - Public financial management, tax policies and revenue administration - Governance, public administration and rule of law - Business environment, growth, trade and investments - Labour market, education and social services, including migration management and integration - Healthcare, welfare and childcare - Green and digital policies - Financial sector and access to finance - Data and statistics - Preparation for membership of the euro area - Public health, security risks, service continuity Through the TSI, the Commission can also help Member States with the preparation and implementation of their Recovery and Resilience Plans (RRPs), which are necessary to access financing from the RRF.\", \"How can a Member State apply for reform support?\": \"Member States have the possibility to indicate their needs for support until the end of the month of October every year. The Commission analyses the requests and enters into dialogue with the national coordinating authorities to assess the country's needs and the options to support the reforms. The Commission starts deploying the projects on the ground after the adoption of the annual work programme of the TSI.\", \"How does the reform support work in practice?\": \"The support may cover all stages of reforms, from the initial design and conceptualization phase, until the implementation, change management and evaluation phase. It can take the form of strategic or technical advice, studies assessing reform needs or options in specific areas, training or in-country missions by experts. The reform support delivered through the TSI: starts with a request of the Member State. Their ownership and engagement is key for the success of reforms.is tailor-made to each case and each country. The Commission identifies and analyses the exact need in each situation.brings to the country a unique combination of expertise. The Commission matches the best mix of expertise to the needs.is hands-on and concrete in delivery.

By integrating a gender perspective to public policies, this reform will contribute to promote equality and fight discrimination.\", \"Can you give an example of how the TSI contributes to modernise the public administration?\": \"The TSI has supported the Supreme Court of Cyprus in modernising the civil procedure rules. The implementation of the new rules will contribute to a fairer, more efficient justice system. This will serve to strengthen the rule of law, speed up justice, and ensure favourable investment conditions and sustainability of growth.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_1608\": {\"Why did you propose CARE and what are the changes to the existing rules?\": \"Given the urgency to address the situation of people who are fleeing Ukraine as a result of the Russia's invasion of Ukraine, today's proposal on Cohesion's Action for Refugees in Europe (CARE) intends to provide additional flexibility in cohesion policy funding to support Member States hosting people fleeing from the war in Ukraine.\", \"What are the main changes introduced by the CARE proposal?\": \"CARE introduces four main changes to cohesion policy rules to maximise the speed and ease with which Member States can help people fleeing Ukraine, while continuing to support regions' recovery: To ease national budgetary pressures, the possibility of 100% EU co-financing for 2014-2020 cohesion policy funding will be extended for the accounting year 2021-2022;Member States and regions will have the possibility to use resources from either the European Fund for Regional Development (ERDF) or the European Social Fund (ESF) for any type of measures to support people fleeing Ukraine. Thanks to this flexibility either fund will be able to support projects even if these would normally be funded by the other one;Member State spending on all actions helping people fleeing Ukraine will be eligible for EU support retroactively as of the start date of the Russian invasion (24 February 2022);The reporting and the programme modifications will be simplified.\", \"Which actions for people fleeing the war in Ukraine can be supported under Cohesion policy funding and FEAD programmes?\": \"Today's proposal concerns the 2014-2020 cohesion policy and FEAD programmes. Cohesion policy funds can support emergency measures such as building reception centres or shelters for refugees and actions in areas like mobile hospitals, sanitation and water supply. Moreover, such funding can provide immediate support in the areas of employment, education and social inclusion. This includes training, language courses, counselling, coaching, psychological assistance, legal support, and access to services such as childcare, healthcare and social services. The Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD) supports measures to provide basic material assistance to the most deprived, including food, clothing and other essential items for personal use.\", \"Can Member States use REACT-EU money for measures for people fleeing the war?\": \"Member States can already programme, or re-programme parts of the resources of Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe (REACT-EU). A significant part of the \\u20ac10 billion from the 2022 REACT-EU is available to Member States to support projects to assist people fleeing Ukraine in line with the overall aim of post-pandemic recovery, without the need for legislative changes. REACT-EU resources already profit from 100% co-financing and a very flexible implementation. Finally, resources under REACT-EU can also be used by Member States to increase the allocation for programmes supported by the FEAD to provide basic material assistance.\", \"How can Member States use the 100% co-financing possibility, do they still need to propose an amendment to their operation programmes?\": \"The possibility to use the 100% co-financing for the ERDF, ESF, CF and FEAD will not need a Commission decision. Thanks to the simplification of the procedures now introduced, Member States only need to notify the Commission.\", \"Will third country nationals fleeing from the war in Ukraine be able to benefit from support measures under cohesion funding?\": \"Yes. Persons affected by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including third country nationals, will be able to benefit from support measures under cohesion funding.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_1534\": {\"Why is EU-wide legislation needed to address violence against women and domestic violence?\": \"Combating violence against women and domestic violence is part of the European Commission's work to protect the EU's core values and uphold the rights enshrined in the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights. As was outlined in President von der Leyen's political guidelines, the EU must do all it can to prevent and combat violence against women, protect victims and punish offenders. Violence against women and domestic violence is pervasive throughout the EU. According to the most recent data from the European Fundamental Rights Agency, an average of one in three women in the EU has experienced physical or sexual violence since the age of 15, although this ranges from 10% to 50% depending on the Member State. The same survey shows that 1 in 20 women have been victims of rape. Rape and sexual assault is more common against women and girls. According to Eurostat, women and girls make up over 90% of rape victims and over 80% of sexual assault victims. Cyber violence is just as prevalent, and a rising issue. In 2020, a World Wide Web Foundation survey found that 1 in 2 young women had experienced gender-based cyber violence. According to the European Institute for Gender Equality, 51% of young women are reluctant to participate in online debates because they have been harassed online. This is also a phenomenon that disproportionately affects women in the public eye. For example, in a 2018 survey, 46.5% of female parliamentarians reported death threats or threats of rape or beating against themselves or their family members, most of which were received online. The data underlines an overwhelming need to do more to address violence against women and domestic violence in the EU, offline and online. All Member States address violence against women and domestic violence in legislation but to different degrees. This creates legal uncertainty about rights of such victims across the EU. Also, there are existing pieces of EU legislation contributing already to this goal, but these are not effective enough. Only a comprehensive legal instrument targeting all components of the problem will trigger the change and effectively contribute to the elimination of violence against women.\", \"What are the main objectives of the proposal?\": \"The Commission is proposing to enshrine in EU law minimum standards to: criminalise certain forms of violence against women;protect victims and improve access to justice;support victims and ensure coordination between relevant services; andprevent these types of crime from happening in the first place. Given the limited availability of EU-wide data on the scale of the problem, the Commission is also proposing to make EU-wide data collection an obligation.\", \"What are the offences that the Commission is proposing to criminalise?\": \"Offences falling under the concept of violence against women and girls are crimes in the vast majority of Member States. However, as the preparatory work for the Commission's proposal has shown, there are gaps in national legislation and therefore the Commission is proposing to have harmonised criminalisation across the EU of the following offences: In line with the view of international human rights bodies, including the Council of Europe, the Commission is proposing the criminalisation of rape, as a (sexual) penetrative act without consent, in all Member States. This addresses the fact that while rape is criminalised in all Member States, 18 Member States require the use of force or threats for it to be punishable.Specific provisions are rarely present in the domestic legal system regarding cyber stalking. This is a modern form of violence, which is often perpetrated against family members or ex-partners, to intensify coercive control and surveillance. With the development of digital tools, these acts have the potential to control every aspect of the life of the person targeted with such activity.Cyber harassment, currently addressed only in four Member States,covers attacks, such as threats, insults or other offensive behaviour, against individuals, notably women and girls, which typically takes place through social media or other online services. Cyber violence particularly impacts women active in public life, such as politicians, journalists and human rights defenders. This can have the effect of silencing women, hindering their societal participation and undermining the principle of democracy as enshrined in the Treaty on European Union. The proposal criminalises cyber harassment where it may have the effect of causing significant psychological harm and where the attacks occur on a wide scale.Non-consensual sharing of intimate images is explicitly criminalised in 10 Member States. Online dissemination of such material can be very harmful for the person concerned due to its propensity for easy, swift and broad distribution and perpetration, as well as its intimate nature.Female genital mutilation is explicitly addressed in criminal law in 15* Member States, while other Member States cover it with general offences, such as bodily injury, mutilation and crimes against health. Female genital mutilation is an exploitative practice that causes irreparable harm to victims and is performed for the purpose of preserving and asserting domination over women and girls and exerting social control over their sexuality.Cyber incitement to violence or hatred. To address the stark increase of public incitement to violence and hatred online based on sex or gender, in particular misogynous incitement to hatred or violence, this Commission's proposal sets minimum rules for the definition and the penalties of the offence of this type of cyber violence.The proposal also introduces the necessary changes to the Child Sexual Abuse Directive, which sets out a dedicated framework for all children. This modification introduces the crime of rape as a further aggravating circumstance, and the notion of lack of consent for children above the age of sexual consent.\", \"What are the penalties for these offences?\": \"With regards to penalties, the Commission proposes to foresee at least the following maximum prison sentences for the respective offences (\\u2018minimum maximum sentences'): Rape: 8 years;Female genital mutilation: 5 years;Cyber stalking: 2 years;Non-consensual sharing of intimate images and cyber harassment: 1 year;Cyber incitement to hatred or violence on the basis of sex or gender: 2 years. The proposal also introduces rape against children as an aggravated circumstance of a maximum prison sentence of at least 12 years. Member States can still impose higher maximum sentences. It will be up to Member States to define the minimum prison sentences for these offences.\", \"How does the proposal fit in with the EU Victim's Rights Directive?\": \"It is a lex specialis to the Victims' Rights Directive. The Victims' Rights Directive applies to all victims of crime. It lays down minimum standards on the rights, protection and support of victims of crime in the EU. It also makes reference to victims of gender\\u2010based violence, victims of sexual violence and victims of violence in a close relationship. However, the Directive does not prescribe specific rules tailored to victims of these types of crime. The current proposal complements the rules of the Victims' Rights Directive to cater for the specific needs of victims of violence against women and domestic violence. In addition to the more specific measures, covered by the current proposal, victims will continue to benefit from the general provisions of the Victims' Rights Directive.\", \"What are the victim's rights to compensation?\": \"The Commission proposes that victims should have the right to claim full compensation from offenders for damages, including the costs of healthcare, support services, rehabilitation, lost income, physical and psychological harm and reputational damage. Victims would be able to file a complaint up to 5 years since the offence has taken place, and up to 10 years, in cases of sexual violence. However, in cases of non-consensual sharing of intimate images, this period would start when the victim learns that the pictures have been illegally posted online. Furthermore, victims will be able to ask for compensation within criminal proceedings and will not have to go through another trial in civil courts to claim compensation. The current initiative strengthens victims' rights to access to compensation, set out in the Compensation Directive. It reinforces the right to compensation from the offender, including by setting up minimum rules on providing such compensation.\", \"Harassment and sexual harassment in the workplace is already prohibited in the EU. Why is the Commission now proposing to address it in this proposal?\": \"It might be illegal but it still takes place. Although harassment and sexual harassment at the workplace is prohibited under criminal or civil legislation in the Member States, it is still largely unrecognised, and many victims do not know where to turn to when it happens. Support, protection and prevention is not sufficient. In a recent public consultation, 50.6% of respondents were not aware their workplace had a policy on sex-based harassment. 51% did not know which national authorities or other bodies they could contact in case of sex-based harassment at work. While the Commission is not proposing the criminal offence definition per se, it is proposing that: Member States must provide dedicated support for victims of sexual harassment at work;Managers in the public and private sectors must receive training on how to detect sexual harassment at work, provide support to victims and respond in an adequate manner;That sexual harassment at work is addressed in relevant national policies. This is not limited to sexual harassment of a physical nature, but covers all forms of unwanted verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.\", \"There is already an existing international framework \\u2013 the Istanbul Convention \\u2013 to tackle violence against women and domestic violence. What will a new EU law add?\": \"The Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, also known as the Istanbul Convention, is widely understood to be the most comprehensive international framework in this area. Not every EU Member State has ratified it, despite the fact that it has a proven record of success. As the Court of Justice of the EU recently ruled in its opinion of 6 October 2021, the EU may decide to accede to the Convention even if not all Member States consent or have ratified the Convention. We expect that negotiations of the accession to quickly resume. The Commission's proposal is different to the Convention in that it sets minimum standards for EU Member States within the areas of EU competence, including the criminalisation of cyber violence offences that is not specifically covered by the Istanbul Convention. The Commission's proposal does not prevent Member States, especially those that are already parties to the Istanbul Convention, from maintaining higher standards.\", \"What will the role of national bodies, such as equality bodies, be?\": \"Equality bodies are national public institutions set up across Europe to tackle discrimination and to promote equality for all. They perform a fundamental role in the non-discrimination architecture of the EU. Violence against women and domestic violence constitute severe forms of discrimination. Equality bodies are already competent to address sex-based harassment, but not yet all bodies are explicitly mandated to carry out their tasks for all forms of violence against women. With this Directive, equality bodies and other national bodies will have an important role to play in raising awareness on matters of violence against women and domestic violence and in assisting victims. In particular, they will have the right to act in support or on behalf of victims, including in support of victim's claims for compensation from the offender and for seeking redress in cases of cyber violence.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_1512\": {\"What is the current situation on energy prices, supply and storage in Europe?\": \"Energy prices are at record highs and remain volatile. Just before the invasion of Ukraine, wholesale gas prices were around 200% higher than a year ago (February 2022). Wholesale electricity prices had followed a similar pattern. High energy prices were originally fuelled by strong global demand for gas in the post-COVID-19 economic recovery, and now Russia's invasion of Ukraine is aggravating the energy crisis even further.  Uncertainties about supplies from Europe's main supplier \\u2013 Russia \\u2013 increase market instability, driving up volatility and prices even further. The outlook for the medium term indicates that energy prices will remain higher than the recent average for some time. Gas storage in the EU is sufficient to cover our needs until the end of this winter heating period, even in case of full disruption of supplies from Russia. The storage filling level across Europe is just under 30% at the moment. Member States have contingency plans ready, as required by the Gas Security of Supply Regulation that can be activated if necessary to guarantee supply. We can rely on a meshed network with pipeline interconnectors between Member States (including the availability for reverse flows) and connected Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminals. All regions now have access to more than one source of gas. We are therefore less vulnerable to supply squeezes coming from an individual supplier than in the past.  The Commission has been monitoring the situation very closely and remained in permanent contact with the Member States. Europe has also made efforts to steadily diversify energy supply routes and sources. The Southern Gas Corridor bringing gas from Azerbaijan is operational, and we are cooperating notably with Norway, Qatar, Japan, South Korea and the US, among others. In 2022, there has been a steep increase in LNG imports into the EU. These imports reached 10 billion cubic metres (bcm) in January, the highest ever amount \\u2013 and provisional figures indicate that volumes have remained high in February.\", \"How much does the EU rely on energy imports from Russia?\": \"The EU is reliant on fossil fuel (gas, oil and coal) imports for our energy needs, amounting to 57% to 60% of gross energy consumption in the past 5 years. Although domestic production of renewable energy sources has increased significantly in recent years, the declining production of EU coal, lignite and gas has meant that the EU remains dependent on imports for gas (90% of consumption), oil (97%) and hard coal (70%). In the gas sector, Russia provided around 45% of the EU's total gas imports in 2021. Over the past years, this number has been on average around 40%. The other main gas suppliers to the EU were Norway (23%), Algeria (12%), the United States (6%) and Qatar (5%). For crude oil, Russia was also the largest supplier of EU imports (27%), followed by Norway (8%), Kazakhstan (8%) and the USA (8%). In the hard coal sector, even though import volumes have declined in recent years, Russia also remains the leading supplier (46%), followed by US (15%) and Australia (13%).\", \"What measures has the Commission proposed to Member States to mitigate high prices?\": \"In October 2021, the Commission presented a Communication on energy prices, including a toolbox, outlining what Member States can do under existing EU rules to help vulnerable consumers and businesses to face high prices. These covered three types of measures in particular: energy subsidies and vouchers, tax reductions and measures to avoid energy disconnection. 25 Member States have introduced special measures in line with the toolbox. The Commission estimates that these measures benefit 71 million household customers and several million micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. The European Central Bank has recently estimated that energy price shocks will reduce GDP growth by around 0.5 percentage points in 2022. The invasion of Ukraine will exacerbate the situation. In today's Communication, the Commission proposes a range of further measures that could be taken at national or EU level to mitigate high prices. The Commission confirms that, in the current exceptional circumstances, Member States can set regulated prices for vulnerable consumers, households and micro-enterprises in order to help protect consumers and our economy. The Commission also confirms that Member States can consider temporary tax measures on windfall profits and exceptionally decide to capture a part of these returns for redistribution to consumers. Such measures need to fulfil certain criteria to ensure that they are proportionate, limited in time and that they avoid undue market distortions. The Commission provides guidance in the Communication in this regard, as well as recalling the possibility to use increased emissions trading revenues to ease pressure on household consumers. EU State aid rules can also offer Member States options to provide short-term support to companies affected by high energy prices, and help reduce their exposure to energy price volatility in the medium to long term. Following a consultation on targeted amendments to the Emissions Trading System State aid Guidelines, the Commission will also be consulting with Member States on the needs for and scope of a new State aid Temporary Crisis Framework to grant aid to companies affected by the crisis, in particular those facing high energy costs.\", \"What measures does the Commission propose to prepare for next winter?\": \"The Commission has carried out an urgent risk preparedness analysis on security of gas supply and shared it with the Member States. The Commission has been modelling the EU preparedness for different gas disruption scenarios. The results indicate the EU's resilience to wide-scale disruptions, and the fact that gas supplies are sufficient even in case of full disruption of supplies from Russia for this winter heating season. Our analysis also shows that it is crucial to ensure the refilling of storage ahead of the next winter heating season. Gas storage usually supplies 25-30% of EU gas consumed in winter. In this Communication, the Commission outlines proposals to achieve higher filling of gas storage levels to be well-prepared for next winter. By April, the Commission will make a legislative proposal on minimum gas storage, establishing a 90% filling target by 1 October each year, designating gas storage as critical infrastructure and tackling the storage infrastructure ownership risks. The Commission will also propose to give full tariff rebates at storage points. As long as EU legislation is not in place, the Commission urges Member States to take measures to refill storage ahead of the next heating season and conclude solidarity arrangements as foreseen by the existing Gas Security Supply Regulation. Considering that not all Member States have storage capacities available on their territory, the Commission proposal will set out a mechanism to ensure a fair allocation of security of supply costs. The Commission will also support coordinated gas refilling operations, for example through joint procurement, collecting orders and matching supplies. On 15 December 2021, the Commission tabled legislative proposals to reinforce the security of gas supply framework with targeted measures to better coordinate storage and enable joint procurement of strategic stocks, as well as strengthening solidarity between Member States. This includes a proposed revision of the EU Security of Supply Regulation which would enable a voluntary joint purchase of strategic reserve stocks. The Commission encourages the EU co-legislators to accelerate the agreement on these proposals.\", \"How is the Commission proposing to eliminate the EU's dependency on Russian gas?\": \"With the objective of phasing out our dependence on fossil fuels from Russia well before 2030, the EU has proposed REPowerEU, a plan, to increase the resilience of its energy system (see question 6) and diversify its gas supply sources via higher LNG and pipeline imports from non-Russian suppliers, and boosting the use of biomethane and renewable hydrogen. Already before the end of the year RePowerEU could result in the EU's gas demand going down by volumes equivalent to two thirds of Russian gas imports from last year. Over the last ten years, the landscape of the European gas market has significantly changed. The market design together with the increased gas interconnection capacity (including reverse flow capabilities) has resulted in major infrastructure improvements including through Projects of Common Interest. Thanks to this, in recent months, the Commission could engage with a range of partners around the world to diversify supplies of gas through pipelines or through LNG. The US, Norway, Qatar, Azerbaijan, Algeria, Egypt, Korea, Japan, Nigeria, Turkey, Israel are among those countries. This has resulted in record volumes of LNG imports in January and February. The EU has the potential to import a further 50 bcm of LNG on a yearly basis. Today's Communication underlines the importance of further diversifying our suppliers and infrastructure, accelerating projects already foreseen and analysing other new infrastructure needed with a strong cross border dimension and hydrogen compatibility. In December 2021, the Commission presented legislative proposals aimed at facilitating the uptake of renewable and low carbon gases, including hydrogen \\u2013 thereby encouraging the decarbonisation of the EU gas market, boosting the diversification of supply, and reinforcing energy security for all citizens in Europe. To boost the EU production of biomethane, the REPowerEU plan would aim for 35 bcm of biomethane production by 2030, doubling the current EU ambition, using sustainable biomass sources such as agricultural wastes and residues. REPowerEU would also create a Hydrogen Accelerator, developing integrated infrastructure, storage facilities and port capacities. The Commission estimates that an additional 15 million tons of renewable hydrogen can replace 25-50 bcm per year of imported Russian gas by 2030 (10 mt imported renewable hydrogen from diverse sources and 5 mt more renewable hydrogen produced in Europe, in addition to the 5 mt already planned).\", \"How can the clean energy transition help reduce faster EU's gas dependency on Russia?\": \"An integrated EU energy system largely-based on renewables and greater energy efficiency is the most-cost effective solution to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels at the level of homes, buildings and industry. This is the second pillar of the Commission's REPowerEU plan. The full implementation of the Commission's Fit for 55 proposals would already lower our gas consumption by 30%, equivalent to 100 bcm, by 2030. The case for energy efficiency has never been stronger, as lowering energy consumption in households and enterprises means not only reducing energy imports from Russia, but also reducing energy costs for EU citizens and businesses. The energy system measures in REPowerEU would support an additional saving of over 25bcm a year. The Communication encourages an accelerated roll-out of solar, wind and heat pumps. This could bring important energy savings and reduce significantly the use of fossil gas for power and in buildings. On solar energy, the Commission estimates that by accelerating the roll out of rooftop solar PV systems by up to 15TWh this year the EU could save an additional 2.5 bcm of gas. We will present a dedicated communication on solar energy in June to unlock solar energy's potential. The Communication also proposes to roll out 10 million heat pumps in the next five years to help European families reduce their dependency on gas and lower their energy bills. By implementing the REPowerEU plan, Europe will have sufficient renewable electricity and renewable gases to accelerate the decarbonisation of Industry based on faster electrification and switch to hydrogen. This will give European industries a competitive advantage and allow for faster reindustrialisation. Investment in renewables is still too often hampered by long permitting procedures and other administrative barriers at national level. Today's Communication looks at how regulatory bottlenecks can be eased to speed up renewables permitting and minimise the time for roll-out of renewable projects and grid infrastructure improvements. The Commission will publish in May a Recommendation on fast permitting for renewable energy projects addressing the key barriers and good practice solutions to tackle them. Similarly, the Commission and the European Investment Bank Group will conclude in 2022 the financing mechanisms that would be best suited to promote the development of power purchase agreements (PPAs) in Europe. A public consultation on both permitting and PPAs is currently ongoing and the guidance should be published before summer.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_1549\": {\"What is InvestEU?\": \"InvestEU provides the EU with crucial long-term funding by leveraging substantial private and public funds in support of a sustainable recovery. It provides crucial support to companies, especially in view of the still ongoing crisis. It also helps mobilising private investments for the EU's policy priorities, such as the European Green Deal and the digital transition. The InvestEU Programme brings together under one roof the multitude of EU financial instruments previously available to support investment in the EU, making funding for investment projects in Europe simpler, more efficient and more flexible. The InvestEU Fund supports four policy areas which represent important policy priorities for the Union and bring high EU added value: sustainable infrastructure; research, innovation and digitisation; small and medium-sized businesses; and social investment and skills. The InvestEU guarantee amounts to \\u20ac26.2 billion, with provisioning from the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and NextGenerationEU resources. The overall investment to be mobilised on this basis is estimated at more than \\u20ac372 billion. There are some major novelties in the InvestEU programme: the guarantee is open to the EIB Group and also to National Promotional Banks and Institutions (NPBIs) and other International Financial Institutions (such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Furthermore, the InvestEU Fund provides for a dedicated scheme to generate additional investment to the benefit of just transition territories \\u2013 those to be most affected by the socio-economic consequences of green transition \\u2013 in complementarity with the Just Transition Fund and the public sector loan facility. Two further components complement the InvestEU Fund: The InvestEU Advisory Hub provides technical support and assistance to help with the preparation, development, structuring and implementation of projects, including capacity building.The InvestEU Portal brings together investors and project promoters by providing an easily-accessible and user-friendly database.\", \"How does InvestEU support the recovery?\": \"InvestEU is the EU's investment programme that plays a major role in supporting the European economy. It provides and attracts long-term funding by mobilising private investment in line with the Union policies. This programme builds on the successful implementation of the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) that was a novel instrument designed to relaunch investments after the past financial crisis. InvestEU plays a particularly important role in the recovery, as EU businesses might need help to access and attract necessary funding, including for innovative projects which might involve more risks and require a European approach. InvestEU is also able to support companies affected by the pandemic crisis. There is a possibility to provide capital support to small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) that were not in difficulty in State aid terms already at the end of 2019, but since then have faced significant risks due to the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, Member States are able to use InvestEU as a tool to implement their recovery and resilience plans under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), if they have indicated so in their recovery and resilience plans. Concretely, funds from RRF allocations may be channelled through Member State compartments under the InvestEU to help with the implementation of the Member States' recovery and resilience plans, while respecting the plan's milestones and targets. Like this, Member States can benefit from the EU guarantee and its high credit rating, giving national and regional investments more firepower.\", \"How does the InvestEU Fund work?\": \"The InvestEU Fund mobilises public and private investment through an EU budget guarantee of \\u20ac26.2 billion that backs the investment projects of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Group and other financial partners, and increases their risk-bearing capacity. The EU budgetary guarantee is indicatively distributed across four policy windows as follows: Sustainable Infrastructure window: \\u20ac9.9 billionResearch, Innovation and Digitisation window: \\u20ac6.6 billionSME window: \\u20ac6.9 billionSocial Investment and Skills window: \\u20ac2.8 billion Strategic investments are mainstreamed across the four policy windows. This includes for instance: providing critical healthcare and supporting the manufacturing capacities for pharmaceuticals; building stronger value chains within the EU, for example regarding the manufacturing capacities for renewable energy technologies; and supporting critical infrastructure, for instance in the field of energy. The guarantee is provisioned at 40%, meaning that \\u20ac10.5 billion of the EU budget is set aside in case calls are made on the guarantee. In addition to the amount budgeted for provisioning the EU guarantee, the budgetary envelope dedicated to advisory support, the project portal and other accompanying measures amounts to \\u20ac430 million. The InvestEU Fund is implemented through financial partners who will invest in projects using the EU guarantee. The main partner is the EIB Group, which has successfully implemented and managed EFSI since its launch in 2015. In addition to the EIB Group, International Financial Institutions active in Europe \\u2013 such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Developments (EBRD) \\u2013 and National Promotional Banks have direct access to the EU guarantee. The EU guarantee is split 75%-25% between the EIB Group and all other implementing partners. Opening up the possibility to benefit from the EU guarantee to other institutions is driven by the fact that there are other experienced potential financial partners in the EU, which have specific financial or sectorial expertise, deep knowledge of their local market or greater capacity to share risk with the EU in some areas. This approach enlarges and diversifies the pipeline of projects and increases the potential pool of final beneficiaries.\", \"What are the InvestEU eligibility criteria?\": \"In order to benefit from InvestEU financing, potential projects must: address market failures or investment gaps and be economically-viable;need EU backing in order to get off the ground;achieve a multiplier effect and where possible crowd-in private investment;help meet EU policy objectives. The policy areas eligible for financing and investment operations are presented in annex II to the InvestEU Regulation The eligibility criteria are further defined in the Investment Guidelines which lay down the requirements that financial products and financing and investment operations shall satisfy.\", \"How does InvestEU provide capital support to SMEs?\": \"InvestEU particularly aims to support SMEs and continues the success from EFSI where over 1.4 million SMEs benefitted from investment projects. The InvestEU programme also allows capital support to help otherwise viable SMEs, that were not in difficulty in State aid terms already at the end of 2019 and that are now faced with liquidity issues due to the coronavirus crisis and its aftermath. It helps such companies at this critical time getting back to a sustainable and profitable business track. Capital support is open under all policy windows and therefore contributes to the EU priorities of the green and digital transitions. Such financing is provided directly by the EIB, the EIF, the EBRD or National Promotional Banks or through financial intermediaries or dedicated vehicles. The financing typically takes place through financial intermediaries that take equity participations, convertible loans and other equity-type financing. These intermediaries are typically independent commercially-run fund managers that select companies with adequate return prospects, driven by a commercial logic when selecting companies in which to invest or provide other forms of financing. The InvestEU intervention is done on commercial terms and crowds in private investors.\", \"Does InvestEU foresee national envelopes?\": \"No, there are no national envelopes as this is a market based and demand driven   instrument. The InvestEU Programme was designed to ensure it benefits all Member States, irrespective of their size or development of their financial market. However, InvestEU foresees Member State compartments, to which Member States may contribute voluntarily in two ways. Member States can contribute through structural funds or contribute funds under the Recovery and Resilience Facility to finance policy priorities in line with their national recovery and resilience plans. Like this, Member States can benefit from the EU guarantee and its high credit rating, giving national and regional investments more firepower.\", \"Who manages InvestEU?\": \"A Steering Board gives strategic direction on programme implementation. It is composed of the Commission (four members), the EIB Group (three members) and other implementing partners (two members) as well as a non-voting expert appointed by the European Parliament. The Steering Board strives to take its decisions by consensus. The Steering Board is assisted by an Advisory Board composed of representatives of the Commission, the implementing partners (one member each) and Member States (one member each). The Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee also have one member each. The Commission is able to consult this board when preparing and designing new financial products or to follow market developments and share information. This Advisory Board is able to issue recommendations to the Steering Board on the implementation and functioning of the InvestEU programme. An Investment Committee composed of 12 independent experts is responsible for approving the individual requests for use of the InvestEU guarantee based on compliance with the eligibility criteria set by the Regulation as well as the Investment Guidelines. The Investment Committee is supported by a secretariat, which is staffed by and located in the Commission. The Committee's decisions are made independently, with no political interference.\", \"How does InvestEU contribute to the green transition?\": \"The InvestEU Programme focuses on the Union's medium- and long-term policy priorities such as the European Green Deal, the Strategy on shaping Europe's digital future and the Strong Social Europe for Just Transitions. To achieve the objectives of the green transition it is important to reach an ambitious climate target for InvestEU. Therefore, the InvestEU Regulation provides that at least 30% of the InvestEU Fund are supporting financing for investments that contribute to the EU's climate objectives. Furthermore, under the \\u201cSustainable Infrastructure Window\\u201d of the InvestEU Fund, 60% of the investments supported are contributing to climate and environmental objectives. Moreover, the InvestEU programme is supporting sustainable investments in all sectors of the EU economy and contributes to more sustainable practices among private and public investors. The InvestEU Regulation also has a reference to the Commission's biodiversity ambition and to its biodiversity goals. To measure the contribution of specific financing and investment operations to the climate and environmental targets of InvestEU, a dedicated climate and environmental tracking methodology has been developed. In addition, a sustainability proofing method has been determined to review the environmental, climate and social impacts of projects, before they are approved. This method will also take into account the \\u2018do no significant harm' principle as well as the technical screening criteria of the EU Taxonomy.\", \"How is the \\u2018do no significant harm principle' operationalised under InvestEU?\": \"In line with the InvestEU Regulation, the Commission has developed sustainability guidance to operationalise the \\u2018do no significant harm' principle. This guidance has been developed in cooperation with Implementing Partners, financial intermediaries and project promoters. It ensures that financing and investment operations receiving InvestEU support are in line with and contribute to the EU broader sustainability commitments. In particular, the sustainability proofing aims at identifying and addressing potential significant impacts the operations may have on the climate, environmental and social dimensions.\", \"What does the just transition scheme under InvestEU entail?\": \"As stated in European Green Deal Investment Plan communication, InvestEU will provide for a dedicated scheme (Pillar 2 of the Just Transition Mechanism) to generate additional investment to the benefit of just transition territories (the Just Transition Scheme, JTS),  in complementarity with the Just Transition Fund (Pillar 1 of the Just Transition Mechanism) and the public sector loan facility (Pillar 3 of the Just Transition Mechanism). This pillar caters mainly for private sector investments and is demand driven, while being linked to the objectives of the territorial just transition plans. Projects supported under the JTS can be located in the just transition territories, but also outside these regions if they are key to the transition within the just transition territories as defined in the respective territorial just transition plans. The JTS is a flexible instrument allowing for both direct and intermediated financing. Such support is implemented through InvestEU financial products proposed by the InvestEU implementing partners (e.g. the European Investment Bank Group, EBRD or national promotional banks or institutions). The InvestEU investment guidelines laying down the requirements for investment operations supported through the InvestEU include a dedicated section on the JTS and its implementation modalities.\", \"How does InvestEU contribute to the digital transition?\": \"Through its \\u201cResearch, Innovation and Digitisation window\\u201d InvestEU supports the digital transition, including by supporting the development of digital solutions for businesses and boosting the development of trustworthy digital technologies in Europe. In particular, InvestEU supports investments in digital infrastructures, technologies, and digital skills. This includes investments in better connectivity, super-computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, cloud, data, the Internet of Things, semiconductors, including microprocessors, data technologies, 5G and quantum technologies, digital transformation of ecosystems and businesses, as well as innovative media content and technologies. Furthermore, the digital investments under InvestEU, in particular the green and digital technologies, are also contributing to a sustainable, climate-neutral and resource-efficient economy.\", \"Can third countries participate in InvestEU?\": \"The InvestEU Fund is open to contributions from third countries (non-EU countries) that are members of the European Free Trade Association, acceding countries, candidates and potential candidates, countries covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy and other countries, in accordance with the conditions laid down between the Union and those countries. This will allow continued cooperation with the relevant countries, in particular in the fields of research and innovation as well as SMEs. According to the Regulation, third countries have to provide their full contribution to financial products in cash.\", \"What are the aims of the InvestEU Advisory Hub?\": \"The InvestEU Advisory Hub is the central entry point for project promoters and intermediaries seeking advisory support and technical assistance related to centrally managed EU investment funds. Managed by the European Commission and financed by the EU budget, the hub connects project promoters and intermediaries with advisory partners, who work directly together to help projects reach the financing stage. The InvestEU Advisory Hub complements the InvestEU Fund by supporting the identification, preparation and development of investment projects across the European Union. It succeeds the European Investment Advisory Hub (EIAH), established by the Commission with the EIB, and builds on the experience acquired through EIAH.\", \"What is the goal of the InvestEU Portal?\": \"The InvestEU Portal provides an easily accessible and user-friendly project database granting visibility to EU-based projects for which project promoters seek financing and which provides investors with information about investment opportunities available in the EU. The InvestEU Portal builds on its predecessor, the European Investment Project Portal (EIPP), having further enhanced features.\", \"When can companies expect to be able to apply for financing supported under InvestEU?\": \"The Commission launched the call for expression of interest for selecting implementing partners other than the EIB Group in 2021. A guarantee agreement with the EIB Group was signed in March 2022 so that companies and project promoters can start applying for financing. Guarantee agreements with other implementing partners will follow in the course of 2022. As a transitional measure, the EIB Group and other implementing partners may also benefit from warehousing possibility that allows them to support companies prior to the signature of guarantee agreements, subject to ex-post approval by the Investment Committee. This will ensure continuity with EFSI and existing financial instruments and anticipated deployment by all implementing partners.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_1477\": {\"Why is the Commission issuing this Communication?\": \"The Communication provides Member States with guidance on the conduct of fiscal policy in 2023. Based on the Commission's Winter 2022 Economic Forecast, and being mindful of the exceptionally high uncertainty surrounding economic developments, including Russia's unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine, the Communication sets out main principles regarding the conduct and coordination of fiscal policy in 2023 and beyond. The latest development underscores the need for strong coordination of economic and fiscal policies and for fiscal policies to stand ready to react to rapidly changing circumstances. The guidance will be adjusted to economic developments as needed. Lastly, the Communication also provides an overview for the state of play on the economic governance review. The Communication takes into account the positive experience with the similar guidance provided by the Commission in March 2021, which contributed to the continuous discussion in the Council, the Eurogroup and with other EU and international stakeholders on the appropriate fiscal policy response to the coronavirus crisis and its adaptation to the evolving situation. The guidance set out in the Communication should guide Member States' forthcoming stability and convergence programmes. Further guidance will be provided in the Commission's European Semester spring package in May 2022, which will include a fiscal policy recommendation to each Member State.\", \"How has the Russian invasion of Ukraine affected the economic outlook?\": \"The Winter 2022 Economic Forecast did not factor in the invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing geopolitical tensions. This impacts negatively the growth outlook and tilts the risks further to the downside. For example, inflation may turn out higher than expected as a result of cost pressures stemming from supply-side bottlenecks. Higher energy prices being passed on from producer to consumer prices to a larger extent, may weigh on aggregate demand. Global supply bottlenecks are likely to persist well into 2022. In addition, higher than expected second-round effects from potentially above-productivity wage increases may keep inflation high over a longer period. Fiscal policies should stand ready to react to rapidly changing circumstances. The Commission will closely monitor the situation and adjust its guidance as needed.\", \"What are the main issues discussed in the Communication?\": \"The Communication sets out five key principles that will guide the Commission's assessment of Member States' stability and convergence programmes and draws implications, based on the Commission 2022 winter economic forecast, for its fiscal recommendations to be proposed to Member States in May 2022 for their budgetary plans for 2023. Exceptional uncertainty and risks call for strong coordination of economic and fiscal policies to transition out of the COVID-19 crisis. The Commission will closely monitor the situation and adjust its policy guidance as needed. The Communication also summarises the state of play on the economic governance review.\", \"What are the five principles set out in the Communication?\": \"The Communication sets out five key principles that will guide the Commission's assessment of Member States' stability and convergence programmes and its fiscal recommendations to be proposed to Member States in May 2022 for their budgetary plans for 2023. These five principles are: Ensure policy coordination and a consistent policy mix. Fiscal policy coordination remains key. A continued strong coordination of fiscal policies is needed to ensure a smooth transition towards a new and sustainable growth path and fiscal sustainability. The appropriate fiscal stance for the euro area should result from a proper balance between sustainability and stabilisation considerations. It is essential to achieve such articulation at the country level and taking into consideration the euro area/EU dimension.Ensure debt sustainability through a gradual and high-quality fiscal adjustment and economic growth. Multi-year fiscal adjustment combined with investment and reforms to sustain growth potential is needed to curb debt dynamics. Ensuring sustainable public finances through a gradual reduction of high public debt is important.Foster investment and promote sustainable growth. All Member States should protect overall investment and, where justified, expand nationally financed investment, including for the green and digital transition. Emphasis should be put on a high quality of investment, in line with investment financed from the RRF.Promote fiscal strategies consistent with a medium-term approach to fiscal adjustment, taking account of the RRF. Fiscal adjustment in high-debt Member States should be gradual, not lead to an overly restrictive fiscal stance, and be underpinned by investment and reforms that relaunch growth potential, facilitating the attainment of credible downward debt trajectories. The path of fiscal policy adjustment should account for the effects of the RRF support on economic activity.Differentiate fiscal strategies and take into account the euro area dimension. Fiscal recommendations should continue to be differentiated across Member States and take into account possible cross-country spillovers.\", \"Does this Communication provide formal fiscal guidance to Member States? How does this differ from the annual European Semester package?\": \"The Communication does not constitute formal guidance to Member States under the European Semester nor under the Stability and Growth Pact. It seeks to provide more clarity to Member States as they prepare their stability and convergence programmes. The guidance contained in the Communication today will provide an input to the upcoming ECOFIN and Eurogroup discussions. Based on those discussions and taking into account the evolving economic situation, the Commission will propose specific fiscal policy guidance to each Member State as part of the European Semester Spring Package in late May 2022.\", \"How will the fiscal guidance for 2023 interact with the Recovery and Resilience Facility?\": \"The Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) contributes to supporting public investments and reforms in Member States, to be achieved by 2026. These investments and reforms will help build resilience and achieve the EU's green and digital goals. The expenditure financed by the RRF with non-repayable support will (i) make it possible to fund high-quality investment projects and (ii) cover costs of productivity-enhancing reforms, without giving rise to higher deficits and debt. Therefore, the RRF financing will boost the economic recovery, foster higher potential growth and support a gradual improvement of fiscal positions, including in Member States with the highest public debt ratios. To maximise the positive effects of RRF funded support: Public investment financed by the Member States should be promoted and protected in medium-term national fiscal plans.Member States' fiscal policies should be reoriented to support the twin green and digital transitions, in order to achieve sustained and sustainable growth.Successful debt reduction strategies should focus on fiscal consolidation, on the quality and composition of public finances, and on promoting growth.\", \"How should Member States design their medium-term fiscal strategies?\": \"The Communication indicates that stability and convergence programmes should demonstrate how Member States' medium-term fiscal plans ensure (i) a gradual reduction of public debt to prudent levels and (ii) sustainable growth through gradual consolidation, investments and reforms. Furthermore, the medium-term plans need to be consistent with Member States' debt sustainability analysis. They should be underpinned with concrete and detailed references to their planned investments and reforms, and should account for the expected timeline of disbursement of EU funds (including RRF grants). Finally, for the period beyond 2023, these plans should focus on pursuing fiscal consolidation to achieve medium-term prudent fiscal positions in a gradual, sustained and growth-friendly manner.\", \"What is the status of the \\u201cgeneral escape clause\\u201d?\": \"The \\u201cgeneral escape clause\\u201d of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) was activated by the Commission and Council in 2020 to allow Member States to undertake measures to deal adequately with the COVID-19 crisis, while departing from the budgetary requirements that would normally apply under the European fiscal framework. While the \\u201cgeneral escape clause\\u201d will continue to apply in 2022, it is expected to be deactivated as of 2023 on the basis of the Commission's Winter 2022 Economic Forecast. This will be reassessed on the basis of the Commission's Spring 2022 Economic Forecast in view of the high uncertainty.\", \"What are the implications of this Communication for the opening of excessive deficit procedures (EDPs) in the course of 2022?\": \"The Commission will not propose to open new excessive deficit procedures (EDPs) in spring 2022. The coronavirus pandemic continues to have an extraordinary macroeconomic and fiscal impact, creating exceptional uncertainty, including for designing a detailed path for fiscal policy. On these grounds, the Commission considers that a decision on whether to place Member States under the EDP should not be taken in spring 2022. The Commission will re-assess the relevance of proposing to open EDPs in autumn 2022.\", \"What is the state of play of the economic governance review?\": \"The coronavirus crisis has highlighted the relevance and importance of many of the challenges that the Commission sought to discuss and address in the public debate on the economic governance framework. Following President von der Leyen's commitment in the State of the Union address to build a consensus on the future of the EU's economic governance framework, in October 2021 the Commission relaunched the public debate on the review of the EU's economic governance framework, inviting other EU institutions and all key stakeholders to engage. The debate is ongoing, drawing on both the Commission's view of the effectiveness of the economic surveillance framework presented in February 2020 and the lessons learnt from the coronavirus crisis. The public debate about the EU fiscal framework focuses in particular on the challenge of a gradual, sustained and growth-friendly reduction to prudent debt levels; the need to sustain public investment at high levels for years to come, including those for the twin transition and to enhance resilience; the importance of a good composition and quality of public finances, the need for counter-cyclical fiscal policy and for creating fiscal room for stabilisation; the importance of strong policy coordination between different policy tools and between the EU and national levels; and the need to simplify the EU framework and to ensure effective enforcement of the EU fiscal framework. The debate is taking place through various fora, including dedicated meetings, workshops and an online survey, which closed on 31 December 2021. The Commission is currently analysing the submissions it has received and will come forward with a summary report in March 2022. The ongoing debate is also providing Member States with an opportunity to reflect on the key objectives of the governance framework, its functioning and new challenges ahead. Discussions are taking place mainly in the Economic and Financial Committee and the Economic Policy Committee, but also at ministerial level in the Council (ECOFIN) and - for specific euro area aspects - among euro area members in the Eurogroup. Based on the ongoing public debate and the discussions with Member States, the Commission will provide orientations on possible changes to the economic governance framework with the objective of achieving a broad-based consensus on the way forward ahead of 2023.\", \"What is the Commission's current thinking on the economic governance review?\": \"In the view of the Commission, the current state of play of the discussions points to a number of key issues, where further and more concrete work could pave the way for an emerging consensus for the future EU fiscal framework: Ensuring debt sustainability and promoting sustainable growth through investment and reforms are key to the success of the EU fiscal framework;More attention to the medium-term in the EU fiscal surveillance appears as a promising avenue;It should be further discussed what insights can be drawn from the design, governance and operation of the RRF; andSimplification, stronger national ownership and better enforcement are key objectives.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_1471\": {\"What is the role of the rule of law conditionality regulation?\": \"For the European Commission, it is a priority to protect citizens' money and make sure that every euro from the budget is spent in line with the rules and generates added value. The Commission works continuously and closely with Member States and with the other EU institutions towards this objective, and has traditionally used a series of tools to that end. For the 2021\\u20132027 budget and NextGenerationEU, an additional layer of protection has been introduced: Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2092 on a general regime of conditionality for the protection of the Union budget. It makes sure that the EU is better equipped to protect the budget by dealing with breaches of the principles of the rule of law that affect or risk affecting the EU budget. This new conditionality regime allows the EU to take measures \\u2013 for example suspension of payments or financial corrections \\u2013 to protect the budget. At the same time, the final recipients and beneficiaries of Union funds should continue to receive their payments directly by the Member States concerned. The instrument complements other tools and procedures to protect the EU budget, for example checks and audits or financial corrections, or investigations by the European Public Prosecutor's office or by the EU's anti-fraud office OLAF. The Commission can only recur to the regulation if the other EU budget protection tools cannot protect the EU budget more effectively. Together with the instruments already in place, the regulation is making sure that every euro goes where it is needed and creates added value for the citizens.\", \"What is the role of the guidelines that the Commission has published today?\": \"The guidelines that the Commission has published today seek to clarify a number of elements related to the application of the conditionality regulation. The guidelines are essential to ensure clarity and predictability as to how the Commission will apply the regulation. They help clarify the conditions that would trigger the application of the regulation, how third parties can report information and how the rights of the final recipients and beneficiaries of EU funding will be protected.\", \"How were these guidelines prepared?\": \"The guidelines have been prepared through a comprehensive process, including preparatory work by the European Commission, and consultations with the European Parliament and the EU Member States. This process fully recognises the importance of the European Parliament and EU Member States as partners throughout the implementation of the regulation. The guidelines also take into account the judgements of the European Court of Justice in cases C-156/21 and C-157/21 concerning the legality of the Conditionality Regulation, released on 16 February 2022.\", \"What do these guidelines foresee?\": \"The purpose of the guidelines is to explain five aspects of the Conditionality Regulation: the conditions to adopt measures;the complementarity between the conditionality regulation and other EU budget protection tools;the need for proportionality of the measures;the procedure and assessment process;the protection of the rights of final recipients or beneficiaries.\", \"Under what conditions will the Commission initiate the procedure under the conditionality regulation?\": \"The Commission will initiate the procedure under the conditionality regulation where it has reasonable grounds to consider the following points, as detailed in the guidelines, fulfilled: at least one of the rule of law principles referred to in the conditionality regulation has been breached in a Member State. These includes the principles of legality, legal certainty, prohibition of arbitrariness of the executive powers, effective judicial protection, separation of powers, non-discrimination and equality before the law.the breach concerns situations or conducts of public authorities or can be attributed to them, if they are relevant for the sound financial management of the Union budget or for the protection of the financial interests of the Union. This includes authorities implementing the EU budget and carrying out financial control, monitoring and audit; investigation and public prosecution services; national courts or administrative authorities; authorities implementing the Recovery and Resilience Plans; or those collecting the sources of revenue for the EU budget.the breach affects or risks seriously affecting the sound financial management of the EU budget or the protection of the EU's financial interests, covering both revenue and expenditure of the budget. There must also be a sufficiently direct relation between the breach and its effects. This assessment will be made on a case\\u2010by\\u2010case basis. When the conditions are met, the Commission will initiate the procedure unless it considers that other procedures set out in Union legislation would allow it to protect the Union budget more effectively.\", \"What is the relation between the conditionality regulation and other EU budget protection instruments?\": \"Before proposing any measures, the Commission will assess whether other procedures would not allow it to protect the Union budget more effectively. These could include the early detection and exclusion system; interruption or suspension of payments, or financial corrections under shared management. In the case of the Recovery and Resilience Facility at the heart of the NextGenerationEU recovery plan, it is possible to proceed with the reduction and recovery of amounts in cases of serious irregularities that have not been corrected by the Member States. The guidelines provide two indicative criteria to determine the effectiveness of the conditionality regulation as compared to other instruments: Firstly, the scope of the effect and/or extent of risk the breach may entail: this is relevant as other procedures may relate only to specific spending programmes or already materialised effects. The conditionality regulation would therefore be more effective for breaches that are widespread or where the effect has not materialised yet.Secondly, the types of remedies available and their suitability to different situations to address the relevant breach: When the EU budget is or risks being affected in a wide manner, due for instance to lack of independence of national courts, the wide variety of possibilities under the Conditionality Regulation that could be imposed until the breach is brought to an end might protect the Union budget more effectively than measures focused on a specific programme or instrument.\", \"What does it mean that the measures need to be proportionate?\": \"The Commission will propose proportionate measures, which means that they must be suitable and necessary to address the issues found and protect the EU budget or the EU's financial interests, without going beyond what is required to achieve this goal. To assess whether the measures are proportionate, the Commission will take into account the nature, duration, gravity and scope of the breaches of the rule of law principles at stake. The guidelines provide details on each of these elements. In addition, the Commission may consider other factors, in particular, the intention of the Member State to put an end to the breach, the degree of cooperation of the Member State with the Commission, or a possible persistence or repetition of the breaches. In its proposal to the Council to adopt measures, the Commission will indicate specific programmes or funds affected or at risk of being affected by the breaches and propose measures related to those programmes or funds. In exceptional circumstances, the measures may also be disconnected from the funds that were/are being affected.\", \"How will the Commission carry out this assessment?\": \"To identify and assess breaches of the principles of the rule of law under the conditionality regulation, the Commission will carry out a thorough qualitative assessment on a case-by-case basis, taking due account of the specific circumstances and contexts of each Member State. The guidelines set out the principles of the methodology that the Commission will use. To gather information to feed into its assessment, the Commission will use various sources of information. These include the Commission's annual Rule of Law report and the EU Justice Scoreboard, decisions by the Court of Justice of the European Union, reports from the European Court of Auditors, the European anti-fraud office OLAF and the European Public Prosecutor's Office, as well as conclusions by relevant international organisations. Complaints are also a useful source of information for the Commission to establish whether the conditionality regulation should be triggered. Any third party that is aware of information and evidence about relevant breaches of the principles of the rule of law is invited to send a complaint, and a complaint form is available on the Commission's website. The Commission may also contact the Member State concerned to gather information or explanations it may need for its assessment. The guidelines explain the different steps of the formal procedure under the conditionality regulation, from sending out of a written notification, to the proposal of measures to the Council and their adoption. Once measures under the regulation have been introduced, the Commission will continue to regularly monitor and reassess the situation in the Member States concerned, taking into account any evidence submitted, as well as the adequacy of any remedial measures adopted by those Member States. The guidelines also explain how measures can be lifted.\", \"How are the rights of final recipients and beneficiaries of Union funding protected?\": \"A key principle in the application of the regulation is that the final recipients and beneficiaries of EU funding should not be affected by measures taken under the regulation. To ensure that, the Member States concerned by the regulation should continue to make any payments due to these recipients or beneficiaries. If the Member States concerned refuse to honour their obligations, the beneficiaries or final recipients concerned should first turn to the competent national authorities. If this is not possible or does not lead to the expected outcome, they can address the Commission. Further information is available on the dedicated Commission website.\", \"When will the Commission act further in the application of the regulation?\": \"The Commission has been applying the regulation since January 2021. Ever since, the Commission has been monitoring the situation across the EU countries and collecting relevant information. The Commission's annual Rule of Law report, decisions by the Court of Justice of the European Union, reports from the European Court of Auditors, as well as conclusions by relevant international organisations are all feeding into the Commission's analysis. Complaints are also a useful source of information for the Commission to establish whether the conditionality regulation should be triggered. The Commission published a complaint form inviting the wide public to send a complaint about possible cases under the conditionality regulation. Moreover, under the conditionality regulation, the Commission may contact the EU Member State concerned and request information. The information requested will feed into the Commission's assessment of whether the conditions to send Member States a notification under the conditionality regime are fulfilled. The Commission will start the procedure if the necessary conditions are fulfilled.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_1355\": {\"How did the Commission assess Italy's first payment request?\": \"On 30 December 2021, Italy submitted to the Commission a request for the disbursement of \\u20ac21 billion under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). The request was based on the achievement of the 51 milestones and targets for the first instalment, as outlined in the Council Implementing Decision approving the plan. They cover reforms in the areas of public administration (including its digitalisation), public procurement, civil and criminal justice, the insolvency framework, the spending review, tertiary education, active labour market policies and the framework law to strengthen the autonomy of people with disabilities. Furthermore, they concern major investments in the field of digitalisation of businesses (\\u201cTransition 4.0\\u201d), energy efficiency and renovation of residential buildings. In line with the RRF Regulation, the Commission had up to two months to carry out its preliminary assessment of the request. With their request, the Italian authorities provided detailed and comprehensive evidence demonstrating the fulfilment of the 51 milestones and targets. The Commission thoroughly assessed this information before endorsing the positive preliminary assessment of the payment request.\", \"What are the next steps?\": \"The Commission has now sent the positive preliminary assessment of Italy's satisfactory fulfilment of the milestones and targets required for this first payment to the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC), asking for its opinion. The EFC's opinion, to be delivered within maximum four weeks, should be taken into account in the Commission's final assessment. The Commission will adopt the decision on the disbursement of the financial contribution, in accordance with the examination procedure, through a comitology committee. Following the adoption of this decision by the Commission, the disbursement to Italy would take place. The amounts disbursed to the Member States will be published in the Recovery and Resilience Scoreboard. The Commission has also shared its positive preliminary assessment with the European Parliament.\", \"How do the milestones and targets achieved by Italy so far effectively support the green transition?\": \"The milestones associated to this first payment request include reforms and investments related to the green transition, such as reforms to make the management of water resources more efficient, as well as reforms that will simplify the legal framework to accelerate the implementation of transport infrastructure projects.  They also include new legislation for better identification and management of hydrological risks, the adoption of measures to curb air pollution and promote biodiversity and specific reforms that will enable green investments. Among others, these specific reforms include the new legislation for the construction and modernisation of waste management plants, as well as the extension of the eligibility period for private works to significantly increase the energy efficiency of buildings.\", \"How do the milestones and targets achieved by Italy so far effectively contribute to the digital transition?\": \"Two key reforms associated to this first payment request support the digitalisation of the Italian public administration. The first one ensures that the public administration may procure Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) solutions in an easier and faster way, by setting up a fast track procedure for the purchase of ICT goods and a digital procurement system. The second one aims at (i) supporting the migration towards cloud solutions by the public administration and (ii) at enhancing data exchange processes between public administrations, by introducing a set of incentives and obligations and by removing regulatory obstacles. Legislative provisions have made the Transition 4.0 funding available for the digitalisation of Italy's small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). The publication of calls for expression of interest, launched in 2021, for Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) in the fields of microelectronics and cloud will contribute to the advancement of European R&D&I and industrial deployment on those sectors. The adoption of the National Plan for New Skills will contribute to define the lines along which digital skills training, both for the employed and unemployed in need for up or re-skilling, will be carried out by public employment services.\", \"How do the milestones and targets achieved by Italy so far contribute to improving Italy's economic and social situation, and its resilience?\": \"The entry into force of the public procurement reform, as foreseen in the 2021 milestones, will contribute to the improvement of the business environment in Italy and to productivity growth in the medium and long term, as well as to macroeconomic stability.  Similarly, the successful implementation of the milestones related to measures aimed at improving tax collection and the efficiency of public spending will contribute to the sustainability of public finances. Furthermore, Italy successfully implemented a set of reforms to improve access and the educational outcomes in the tertiary education system. The adoption of the Worker Employability Guarantee (GOL) and the National plan for New Skills, as well as the provision of support to women's entrepreneurships, are expected to contribute to the efficiency and fairness of the labour markets. The entry into force of the Framework Law to strengthen the autonomy of people with disabilities will also contribute to their social inclusion. The adoption of the reorganisation plan by the Ministry of Health, together with the Italian Regions, will contribute to the increase in the availability of intensive care units throughout the country and will support the resilience of the healthcare sector.\", \"Does the achievement of these first milestones and targets contribute to an effective implementation of the Plan?\": \"The measures introduced by Italy so far to simplify administrative procedures, boost administrative capacity, and increase the efficiency and speed of public procurement constitute essential prerequisites to ensure a timely implementation of projects envisaged in Italy's Recovery and Resilience Plan (RRP) until 2026. Furthermore, the governance framework and the audit and control system that have been put in place specifically for the Italian RRP are aimed at ensuring an effective implementation and monitoring of reforms and investments, including through enhanced central coordination, early detection of issues and provision of technical assistance to administrations, notably at local level.  Finally, the reforms of the justice system will contribute to creating a more effective legal context for businesses and citizens, and ultimately for the deployment of the RRP projects.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_1358\": {\"How did the Commission assess Greece's first payment request?\": \"On 29 December 2021, Greece submitted to the Commission a request for the disbursement of \\u20ac3.6 billion under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF).

They cover important reforms in the areas of electric mobility, waste management, labour market regulation, taxation, healthcare, public transport, as well as Greece's audit and control system for the implementation of the RRF. Furthermore, they also include the establishment of the framework for the Loan Facility, which is expected to channel substantial liquidity to private investments over the next five years, and the launch of energy-efficiency enhancing renovations of residential buildings. In line with the RRF Regulation, the Commission had up to two months to carry out its preliminary assessment of the request.

This included the launch of a new round of the energy-efficiency enhancing residential renovation programme (\\u2018\\u0395\\u03a7\\u039f\\u0399\\u039a\\u039f\\u039d\\u039f\\u039c\\u03a9'). Renovations of more than 100.000 residential buildings will be funded under the Plan, reducing their primary energy consumption by at least 30% by 2025. In addition, the Greek government has established a comprehensive regulatory framework to promote the installation and operation of charging points for electric vehicles across Greece, putting the country on the path to meet its target of a 30% share of electric vehicles in the domestic market by 2030, as stated in Greece's National Energy and Climate Plan. A new waste management law has been adopted to support Greece's transition towards a circular economy. The government has also adopted an energy poverty action plan with targeted policy measures to help economically vulnerable households improve the energy-efficiency of their residential buildings. Finally, the framework for the disbursement of loans to the private sector through the Loan Facility has been put in place. This will ensure that at least 37% of such loans will contribute to the climate transition.\", \"How do the milestones achieved by Greece so far effectively contribute to the digital transition?\": \"Digitalisation is a key element of many reforms and investments in the Greek Plan. Several milestones achieved for this payment contribute to the digital transition. These include the update of the IT tool used to monitor the labour market, as well as the promotion of private investments in digitalisation and innovation through the commitment to invest at least 20% of the Loan Facility to support the digital transition. The fulfilment of further investments and reforms supporting the digital transition will be assessed in the context of the next payment requests.\", \"How do the milestones achieved so far contribute to improving Greece's economic and social situation, and its resilience?\": \"A number of milestones achieved for this specific payment are geared to improve the economic and social situation of Greece, as well as its resilience. A critical milestone that has been completed is the launch of the Loan Facility. This has been achieved through the adoption of its framework, as well as agreements signed with International Financial Institutions and the call for proposals for commercial banks. The Loan Facility is expected to provide substantial liquidity to the private sector over the next five years, in order to support investments in the green and digital transition and innovation. Other important steps were taken to improve the economic and social situation of the country through the adoption of the new labour law aimed at modernising individual and collective labour legislation, trade union legislation, the relevant IT system to monitor the labour market, as well as the framework on work-life balance. The reform's overarching objectives are to increase job creation and competitiveness, fight undeclared and under-declared work, improve work-life balance and bridge the gender employment gap. Furthermore, the reform of the Greek public employment services (OAED) is expected to improve the quality of services through an organisational reform, renovations of the local OAED branches, a new communication strategy, monitoring tools to measure effectiveness, efficiency, productivity and customer satisfaction, as well as new forms of profiling and counselling services.\", \"Does the achievement of these first milestones contribute to an effective implementation of the Plan?\": \"The achievement of these milestones significantly contributes to an effective implementation of the Plan, as a number of them contain legislative steps paving the way for the reforms and investments that are planned for the later implementation stages of the Plan. Beyond those mentioned above, these include the codification and simplification of tax legislation, an incentivisation regime for productivity and extroversion of enterprises, as well as an organisational reform of the railways sector. The milestones achieved also contain the set-up of a comprehensive audit and control system, which will help the Greek authorities effectively monitor the implementation of the Plan.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_1401\": {\"What are EU sanctions?\": \"Restrictive measures (sanctions) are an essential tool in the EU's common foreign and security policy (CFSP), through which the EU can intervene where necessary to prevent conflict or respond to emerging or current crises. In spite of their colloquial name \\u2018sanctions', EU restrictive measures are not punitive. They are intended to bring about a change in policy or activity by targeting entities and individuals in non-EU countries, responsible for such malignant behaviour.\", \"What types of sanctions are there?\": \"EU sanctions may target members of government bodies of non-EU countries, as well as companies, groups, organisations, or individuals through the following measures: arms embargoesrestrictions on admission (travel bans)asset freezesother economic measures such as restrictions on imports and exports. EU sanctions are carefully targeted, and designed to be proportionate to the objectives they seek to achieve. As such, they are aimed at those responsible for policies or actions the EU wants to influence, while reducing as much as possible any unintended consequences.\", \"How are EU sanctions regimes and listings adopted?\": \"The Council of the EU (The Council) decides by unanimity on adopting, renewing, or lifting EU restrictive measures (sanctions), on the basis of legislative proposals from the EU High Representative. Once political agreement is reached among EU Member States, the necessary legal acts, in the form of a Council Decision and an accompanying Council Regulation, are prepared by the High Representative/Vice President and the Commission, and submitted to the Council for adoption.[1] The Council takes decisions on specific listings based on the listing criteria set out in the Council Decision and Council Regulation. Any decision to extend or expand restrictive measures is for the Council to take, acting by unanimity. The application of EU sanctions is the primary responsibility of Member States, which must implement them in their respective jurisdictions.\", \"What is the role of the Commission in the proposal, adoption and implementation of sanctions?\": \"As guardian of the treaties, the Commission oversees the application of Union law and ensures the uniform application of sanctions throughout the EU. To this end, it may issue opinions to the competent authorities of the Member States on the interpretation of specific provisions of the relevant legal acts, or provide guidance on their implementation. The Commission also monitors the proper enforcement of sanctions, and may launch an infringement procedure against Member States for failure to comply with their obligations under EU law. The Commission and the national competent authorities (NCAs) work in close contact with EU operators and provide them with guidance and support to ensure that any business conducted in environments subject to EU sanctions remains lawful. Regular exchanges of information take place between the Commission and the NCAs with regard to different aspects of sanctions implementation, from the amounts of assets frozen to derogations granted as well as enforcement issues that they may encounter in their jurisdiction. The effective implementation and enforcement of EU sanctions are a priority for the Commission. The Commission is increasingly supporting Member States in their application of sanctions, by answering questions of interpretation raised by NCAs and economic and humanitarian operators. On 19 January 2021, the Commission put forward a number of proposals to further enhance the uniform implementation and proper enforcement of EU sanctions[2].\", \"Who is bound by EU sanctions?\": \"Council Decisions are directly binding on EU Member States. Council Regulations, as a legal act of general application, are binding on any person or entity under EU jurisdiction. Member States are responsible for the implementation of EU sanctions, as well as identifying breaches and imposing penalties. As guardian of the Treaties, the Commission ensures the uniform implementation of EU law and monitors its enforcement by the Member States. Though EU sanctions are expected to produce effects in third countries through pressure on listed persons, they do not apply extraterritorially. In other words, they do not create obligations for non-EU persons or entities, unless the business is conducted at least partly within the EU. In parallel, and as a matter of principle, the EU does not recognise the extraterritorial application of laws adopted by third countries and considers such effects to be contrary to international law.\", \"What type of exchanges of information with Member States take place?\": \"As set out in Council Regulations imposing sanctions, the Commission and Member States have an obligation to exchange information in respect of violation and enforcement problems. In this regard, if possible breaches of EU sanctions laid down in Council Regulations have been brought to the Commission's attention, the content of those communications cannot be disclosed, as they concern either mere allegations where the breach is not established or ongoing investigations conducted by law enforcement or judiciary authorities, in which the Commission cannot interfere.\", \"What happens in case of allegations of breaches of sanctions coming from media?\": \"The Commission closely follows any credible allegation of breaches reported in the media and assesses the reports/information provided before deciding whether to bring the issue to the attention of national authorities. The Commission remains in contact with the national authorities concerning the investigations and their outcome.\", \"What can the Commission do about breaches of a specific sanctions regulation?\": \"The application of EU restrictive measures (sanctions) is the primary responsibility of Member States. As guardian of the Treaties, the European Commission has a monitoring role in ensuring the uniform application of sanctions, and may issue opinions to the competent authorities in Member States on the application of specific provisions of the relevant legal acts or guidance on their implementation. The Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) assign different competences and roles to the respective actors involved in the proposal, adoption and implementation of EU sanctions. The ultimate responsibility for the correct application and enforcement of EU sanctions rests with the Member States. Member States are responsible for identifying breaches. Therefore the task of conducting investigations into potential non-compliance cases falls within the competence of the different NCAs. In addition, Member States have a legal obligation to adopt national rules providing for effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties to be applied in the event of infringements of the provisions of the relevant Regulations. The Commission has a monitoring role in ensuring the proper enforcement of these measures in certain areas. Pursuant to Article 258 TFEU, the Commission can launch an infringement procedure against Member States for failure to comply with their obligations under EU law.\", \"Has the European Commission ever launched an infringement procedure against a Member State for the non-implementation of sanctions?\": \"To date, the Commission has not launched an infringement procedure against a Member State for the misapplication of EU sanctions.\", \"How many people work in 'sanctions' and how many cases have they handled on non-implementation of sanctions since they started work - can you give examples?\": \"Responsibility for EU sanctions is shared between the EU and Member States. It is therefore not straightforward to give a specific figure on how many persons work \\u2018in sanctions'. As regards cases of non-implementation of sanctions, Member States are primarily responsible for the implementation of EU sanctions and for identifying breaches, as well as applying penalties in such cases. The Commission monitors enforcement by the Member States and follows up on any credible allegation of breaches brought to its attention (for instance, by or in the media). After assessing the information, the Commission decides whether to bring the issue to the attention of national authorities. The Commission remains in contact with the national authorities concerning the investigations and their outcome.\", \"Does the Commission monitor the implementation of arms embargoes / travel bans?\": \"With regard to the sanctions adopted in a given situation, arms embargos and the travel ban are only laid down in a Council Decision (CFSP), which is binding on Member States. Member States have an obligation to take the necessary measures to prevent the entry into, or transit through, their territories of the persons who are subject to sanctions as listed in an Annex to a Council Decision (CFSP). Arms embargos and travel bans are not part of a Council Regulation (EU). As a result, the Commission cannot monitor implementation or open an infringement procedure. However, certain provisions related to the arms embargo, such as prohibitions on the provision of technical and financial assistance, are laid down in Council Regulations and directly applicable.\", \"Can Member States impose penalties on those not respecting a sanctions regime?\": \"Council Regulations imposing sanctions require Member States to lay down the rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of these Regulations and take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. The penalties provided for must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\", \"How is it ensured that sanctions are targeted and that the unintended negative effects of sanctions are minimised?\": \"EU sanctions are targeted at those responsible for policies the EU wants to influence. As such, the measures target only the persons and/or entities in the Annex to a Regulation. The EU's principled position is that sanctions should always be targeted in such a way as to minimise any adverse humanitarian effects or unintended consequences for non-targeted persons. Proportionality is also ensured through regular reviews of sanctions regimes and a system of exceptions (whereby the sanctions do not apply e.g. to meet the basic needs of, or provide medical treatment to the designated persons and to deliver humanitarian aid and related goods).\", \"Where can I find more information?\": \"On 19 January 2021, the Commission adopted a Communication aimed at helping the EU to continue enjoying the benefits of openness towards global partners while protecting itself against unfair and abusive practices. The text is available here When conducting business, you should make sure to comply with prohibitions. To check if a specific individual or entity is listed, you can use the search function of the EU Sanctions Map maintained by the Commission: www.sanctionsmap.eu/.

Key issues include the lack of clarity regarding who can use and access data data generated by connected products, the fact that SMEs are frequently not in a position to negotiate balanced data-sharing agreements with stronger market players, barriers to switching between competitive and trustworthy cloud and edge services in the EU, and the limited ability to combine data emanating from different sectors. This affects a range of economic sectors and leads to an underutilisation of data at EU level, with negative consequences for consumer choice, innovation and public service delivery. The Data Act will remove barriers to access data, for both private and public sector bodies, while preserving incentives to invest in data generation by ensuring a balanced control over the data for its creators. It will unlock the value of data generated by connected objects in Europe, one of the key areas for innovation in the coming decades. It will clarify who can create value from such data and under which conditions. It will ensure fairness in the allocation of data value among the actors in the data economy and in their contracts while respecting the legitimate interests of companies and individuals that invest in data products and services. The new rules will empower consumers and companies by giving them a say on what can be done with the data generated by their connected products.\", \"What is in it for people and businesses?\": \"When you buy a \\u2018traditional' product, you acquire all parts and accessories of that product. However, when you buy a connected product (e.g. a smart home appliance or smart industrial machinery) generating data, it is often not clear who can do what with the data. Or it may be stipulated in the contract that all data generated is exclusively harvested and used by the manufacturer. The Data Act will give both individuals and businesses more control over their data through a reinforced data portability right, copying or transferring data easily from across different services, where the data are generated through smart objects, machines and devices. For example, a car or machinery owner could choose to share data generated by their use with its insurance company.  Such data, aggregated from multiple users, could also help to develop or improve other digital services, e.g. regarding traffic, or areas at high risk of accidents. It will be easier to transfer data to and between service providers and this will encourage more actors, including SMEs, to participate in the data economy. Examples: Aftermarket service providers will be able to improve and innovate their services and compete on an equal footing with comparable services offered by manufacturers. Therefore, users of connected products (including consumers, farmers, airlines, construction companies or owners of buildings) could opt for a cheaper repair and maintenance provider (or maintain and repair themselves) and benefit from lower prices on that market. This could extend the lifespan of connected products, thereby contributing to the Green Deal objectives. Also, availability of data about the functioning of industrial equipment will allow factories, farms or construction companies to optimise operational cycles, production lines and supply chain management, including based on machine-learning. In precision agriculture, IoT analytics of data from connected equipment can help farmers analyse real time data like weather, temperature, moisture, or GPS signals and provide insights on how to optimise and increase yield, improve farm planning and make smarter decisions about the level of resources needed. Increased business and manufacturing efficiency should lead to a reduction of waste, energy consumption and CO2 emissions.\", \"What is in it for SMEs?\": \"Freedom of contract remains the underlying principle but SMEs will now be protected against unfair contractual terms, due to the list of unilaterally imposed contractual clauses that will be deemed or presumed to be unfair. Clauses that do not pass this \\u201cunfairness test\\u201d will be not be binding on SMEs. For example, a clause stating that a company can unilaterally interpret the terms of the contract. In furtherance of this, the Commission will develop and recommend non-binding model contractual terms. These standard clauses will help SMEs negotiate fairer and balanced data sharing contracts with companies enjoying a significantly stronger bargaining position. An independent Expert Group on B2B data sharing and cloud contracts will assist the Commission in this task.\", \"What is in it for governments?\": \"The Data Act aims to unlock the value of data from private companies in exceptional situations of high public interest, such as floods or wildfires. The current data access mechanisms by the public sector are inefficient or non-existent in public emergency situations. With the new rules, there will be an obligation on businesses to provide certain data, under key conditions (which businesses can enforce in case of abuse). If the data is necessary to address a public emergency, it will be provided for free. In other situations: to prevent or recover from a public emergency, or to fulfil a public-interest mandate imposed by law -- the data holder may request compensation. It should greatly improve evidence-based decision-making, in particular effective and rapid response to crises, such as floods and wildfires. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, aggregated and anonymised location data from mobile network operators was essential for analysing the correlation of mobility and the spread of the virus, including informing early warning systems for new outbreaks and taking the right measures to combat the crisis.\", \"Will the new rules touch upon cloud services?\": \"Yes, data processing services, such as cloud and edge services provide the computing and storage capacities on which the data economy is built. They are a precondition for the innovative use of data. The Data Act will improve the conditions under which businesses and consumers can use cloud and edge services in the EU. It will be easier to move data and applications (from private photo archives to entire business administrations) from one provider to another without incurring any costs, because of new contractual obligations that the proposal presents for cloud providers, and a new standardisation framework for data and cloud interoperability. In this respect, the Data Act will build on the strengths of the European standardisation organisations and other interested parties on the market. In addition, the Data Act will raise trust by introducing mandatory safeguards to protect data held on cloud infrastructures in the EU. This will avoid unlawful access by non-EU/EEA governments. With these measures, the Data Act will support cloud adoption in Europe, which will in turn stimulate efficient data sharing within and across sectors.\", \"How can the allocation of value in the data economy be improved?\": \"The Data Act creates a fairer allocation of value by addressing situations where data is currently used exclusively only by a few actors. In the context of connected objects, manufacturers have developed business models offering smart functions that typically generate data. In many cases, these data are currently locked in, the manufacturer can track the use of the object and offer repair and maintenance even before a problem occurs. The Data Act will enable access to data to the users of such objects. That will spur the development of a broader range of services by third parties with whom the user accepts to share data, typically for a better price or quality of services. Furthermore, the Data Act will protect small and medium-sized companies from certain clauses in data sharing or use contracts that would make data sharing partnerships unattractive. Example: A farmer wants to optimise the use of the different equipment as well as seeds and fertilizer on his farm and wants to entrust this to a farm optimisation software from a specialised vendor. The Data Act will give him the rights to obtain all relevant data. A start-up develops an algorithm it wishes to train on the database of a large company, they sign a contract. The large company then decides to offer services resulting from a similar algorithm to be trained on the same database. The start-up will be protected by the Data Act from unduly short cancellation of their contract.\", \"Will companies lose control on the data generated by their products?\": \"Companies' capacity to use data of objects they manufacture remains unaffected. Furthermore, the third party selected by the user compensates the manufacturer for the costs of granting access, i.e. of technical arrangements to make the data available, such as application programming interfaces. In addition to that, safeguards provided for in the proposal prevent situations where the data is used in any manner that would negatively impact on the manufacturer's business opportunities. This includes using it to develop a product or related service that would compete with the original data-generating product, or where the data is used by parties without an appropriate basis for the use, through the appropriate technical protection measures.\", \"What is the relation with the data strategy of February 2020?\": \"Following the Data Governance Act, the Data Act proposal is the second main legislative initiatives resulting from the February 2020 European strategy for data, which aims to make the EU a leader in our data-driven society. While the Data Governance Act, presented in November 2020 and agreed by co-legislators in November 2021, creates the processes and structures to facilitate data sharing by companies, individuals and the public sector, the Data Act clarifies who can create value from data and under which conditions. The Data Act is the last horizontal building block of the Commission's data strategy. In line with the Open Data Directive, it is expected that an Implementing Act establishing a list of High-Value Datasets to be made available by the public sector for free and through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) will be adopted in the coming months.\", \"What is the link between the Database Directive and the Data Act?\": \"The Data Act reviews certain aspects of the Database Directive, which was created in the 1990s to protect investments in the structured presentation of data. It clarifies that this directive cannot be used to prevent data generated by a connected product or related service from being accessed. Because of the growing rollout of IoT technologies and of the vast volumes of data produced by sensors, data holders could otherwise de facto claim exclusivity over data generated by connected products, which, if unaddressed, would hinder the effective application of the access and portability rights laid out in the Data Act.\", \"How does the GDPR apply to connected objects?\": \"The Data Act is fully consistent with and builds on General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules. This applies in particular to the right to data portability that allows data subjects to move their data between controllers who offer competing services. Under the GDPR, this right is limited to personal data processed on certain legal bases and where technically feasible. The Data Act will enhance this right for connected products so that consumers can access and port any data generated by the product, both personal and non-personal.\", \"How does the proposal relate to the announced data spaces?\": \"As a result of its provisions on data access and use and interoperability, the Data Act will contribute to more data being available, also for and within the sectoral data spaces. For instance, building on the Data Act, the common European energy data space will enhance the interoperability of energy assets and services, as well as the flexibility and the overall security and reliability of the energy system. As part of the Digitalisation of Energy Action Plan, this will contribute to priorities of both the Green Deal and the Digital Decade. The European data strategy of February 2020 announced the creation of data spaces in 10 strategic fields: health, agriculture, manufacturing, energy, mobility, financial, public administration, skills, the European Open Science Cloud and the crosscutting key priority of meeting the Green Deal objectives. Since then, data spaces in other important areas such as media and cultural heritage have also emerged. The ultimate goal is that together, the data spaces will form a single European data space: a genuine single market for data. The Staff Working Document on Common European Data Spaces, published together with the Data Act, provides an overview of the common European data spaces. The Commission supports the development of data spaces through its funding programmes (Digital Europe Programme, Horizon Europe, Connecting Europe Facility) Stakeholders in the data economy are  encouraged to build up data spaces. The Commission will further report on the development of common European data spaces in 2023. Expert Group on B2B data sharing and cloud computing contracts Together with the adoption of the proposal on the Data Act, the Commission will publish on the Register of the Expert Groups a Call for applications for an Expert Group on B2B data sharing and cloud contracts. The Expert Group will assist the Commission in developing model contractual terms for B2B data sharing and standard contractual clauses for cloud computing contracts. The Expert Group will consist of experts in their individual capacity. The deadline for applications is 6 April.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_1257\": {\"What progress has been achieved in developing the battery value chain in Europe so far?\": \"The industry-led European Battery Alliance was established in October 2017 to achieve strategic autonomy in one of the most fundamental sectors of the future green and digital economy. Currently, the Alliance counts over 700 industrial and innovation members. The efforts are centred on building a sustainable and vertically-integrated battery value chain in Europe, to ensure a secure supply of green, safe and high-performing batteries, while also gaining a significant share of the global battery market. Thanks to the collaborative and ambitious cross-cutting policy approach adopted by the Commission and Member States, and supported by other institutions and European banks, Europe has turned a battery greenfield project into one of its fastest growing industries. In 2021, despite the coronavirus pandemic and significant supply disruptions, Europe continued its efforts and succeeded in anchoring its position as a frontrunner in the global sustainable battery market. So far, 111 industrial battery projects are being developed across EU Member States, with some 20 battery cells Gigafactories. The EU is set to meet 69% and 89% of its increasing demand for batteries by 2025 and 2030 respectively, and should be capable of producing batteries for up to 11 million cars per year. The total level of investment along the battery value chain amounted to \\u20ac127 billion by 2021. Additional investment of some \\u20ac382 billion is expected to create a self-sufficient battery industry by 2030. With this pace of investment, the annual added value created by the battery industry would be an estimated \\u20ac625 billion by 2030.\", \"Does this go hand in hand with the surge in e-mobility?\": \"The expanding battery industry will be key to meeting Europe's growing demand for batteries. This in turn is being driven notably by the surge in e-mobility, which reached new heights in 2021. Despite the disruption on the automotive market in Europe caused by the drop in the overall sales of cars exacerbated by chip and magnesium supply disruptions, the sales of electric vehicles (eVs) between January and November of 2021 reached some 1.5 million units representing a record high market share of 17.2%, a figure which is likely to hit 21% across the whole of 2021. Europe has retained its position among the global leaders in e-mobility next to China, which, with some 2.7 million between January and November of 2021, saw eV sales reaching 14.3% of market share. The surge in e-mobility has been accompanied by an upward trend in the installation of public recharging points in the EU, which reached 302,417 in 2021 (up from 206,511 in 2020).\", \"How did the Commission support the development of the battery industry in 2021?\": \"In 2021, the Commission approved the second battery-related Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI), jointly notified by 12 Member States, with a total value of \\u20ac12 billion. It complements the first battery-related IPCEI with a total value of \\u20ac8.2 billion, which was adopted in 2019. In 2021, the Commission launched calls for proposal for battery research projects of \\u20ac160 million. The calls were a success: they resulted in 61 projects proposals being submitted. In total, some \\u20ac925 million will be allocated to battery research from the EU budget up to 2027. In 2021, the Commission adopted, as part of the Fit for \\u201c55 package\\u201d, legislative proposal which will further foster the development of the battery market in Europe, including regulations laying down stricter CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger cars and vans, and new rules to provide a broad roll-out of the recharging infrastructure across all EU Member States.\", \"What are the key priority areas for the European Battery Alliance in 2022?\": \"Since the establishment of the Alliance there was a good overall progress in developing the battery value chain in Europe and the recent initiatives addressing the emerging challenges. However, further concerted efforts are needed by Team Europe. The Commission has identified the following priorities for 2022: Providing a new legal framework for the battery industry;Diversifying supply sources and routes for battery raw materials;Streamlining and accelerating permitting procedures for battery raw material projects at national and regional level;Improving and facilitating access to funding for primary and secondary battery raw materials projects; andLaunching of national re-skilling and up-skilling programmes.\", \"What was the main purpose of the High-Level Meeting?\": \"Since its establishment in 2017, the European Battery Alliance meets annually at Ministerial level. Today, the sixth high-level meeting of the European Battery Alliance took place in Brussels to discuss the progress achieved in developing the battery value chain in Europe and to address the most pressing challenges on the way forward. In particular, the discussion focused on how to strengthen the resilience of the European battery industry by securing supplies of sustainable critical raw materials and how to coordinate re-skilling and up-skilling efforts at European level, by swiftly rolling out high-quality training across Member States. To help address the skills gap, estimated at 800.000 people by 2025, the Commission formally launched the European Battery Academy in the margins of the High-level meeting. By signing a letter of intent between the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and EIT InnoEnergy, the Commission will support the Academy with a grant of \\u20ac10 million under the REACT-EU.\", \"What will the newly-launched European Battery Academy do?\": \"The continuation of the European battery success story will depend on Europe's ability to address the emerging skills gap. The manufacturing and recycling of batteries requires a specific set of skills: it focusses on high-quality, high-volumetric and highly-digital production processes often involving the handling of chemicals. The European labour market does not yet sufficiently meet the demand for a skilled, qualified and experienced workforce. This is mainly because the battery ecosystem is still in its infancy, and the lack of a directly compatible sector on which to draw. According to industrial estimates, 800,000 workers will need to learn new or additional skills in the battery industry by 2025. The launch of the European Battery Academy is a concrete action to make sure Europe has a sufficient number of skilled workers in the battery industry to ensure its continued successful growth. The European Battery Academy was designed to identify and frame the main skill demands across the European battery value chain. Based on industrial insights and up-to-date skills intelligence, the European Battery Academy will develop training programmes and learning content to address skill gaps, including online learning modules, in-person training and training manuals. As a tangible contribution under the Pact for Skills, the EU is supporting the Academy with a grant of \\u20ac10 million under the Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe (REACT-EU). Three Member States \\u2013 Spain, France and Hungary \\u2013 have already engaged with the Academy by signing Memoranda of Understanding to train up to 150,000 workers in each of the first two countries and up to 40,000 workers in the latter. The Academy complements existing long-term initiatives, such as the Blueprint Alliances under the Erasmus+ programme: the Alliance for Batteries Technology, Training and Skills (ALBATTS) and Development and Research on Innovative Vocational Educational Skills (or DRIVES). It also complements, the industry-led Automotive Skills Alliance launched in November 2020 as one of the first sectoral partnerships created under the Commission's European Skills Agenda.\", \"How do we tackle access to critical raw materials for batteries?\": \"In September 2020, the Commission adopted the Critical Raw Materials Action Plan, which highlights 10 priority work areas for the EU to reinforce resilience of its raw materials industry. The Action Plan was accompanied by a list of 30 critical raw materials, and a foresight study in 2020 on future raw materials demand for strategic technologies and sectors, which shows that the demand for raw materials will increase significantly. The Commission's approach to securing supplies of critical raw materials is based on developing most valuable and sustainable domestic projects. This is why our European Industrial Alliances on batteries and raw materials (EBA and ERMA) are mobilising investments to accelerate responsible and sustainable battery raw materials projects in the EU.  For example, lithium extraction projects are progressing in different EU countries to become operational (FI, ES, PT, CZ, DE, AT). Current mineral resources estimates more than double the figures available in November 2020, from 2.2 to 5.5 million tonnes of lithium. This increase is largely due to the new geothermal lithium project in the Upper Rhine valley (DE), which is adding 3.2 Mt of lithium mineral resources. In addition to these, there are new development projects in Portugal and Spain. All these potentially viable projects will allow us to keep our wider objective unchanged to cover up to 80 % of Europe's lithium needs from EU domestic sources. Streamlining national permitting procedures and ensuring compliance with the environmental acquis and the highest standards on transparency and public engagement, will be key to strengthening Europe's domestic capacities. In order to ensure that battery raw materials projects are developed in a fully sustainable and socially acceptable way, in 2020 the Commission adopted a batteries regulation proposal, which lays down strict due diligence requirements for all battery raw materials-related activities. These requirements, based on the guidelines of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), will apply to all critical raw materials used for batteries placed on the EU market regardless of their origin. Furthermore, in September 2021, the Commission published the EU Principles for Sustainable Raw Materials. These voluntary guidelines provide an integrated approach to sustainable raw materials extraction and processing in Europe in terms of social, environmental and economic performance. In 2021, the Commission also published a report, which provides examples of best practices and a list of recommendations for the environmental impact assessments of minerals extraction projects. Furthermore, we are building strategic partnerships with like-minded trade partners reach in critical raw materials. The Commission has adopted two strategic partnerships on raw materials, one with Canada in June 2021 and one with Ukraine in July 2021, with the aim of achieving a closer integration of raw materials and batteries value chains. The Commission will continue exploring possibilities to enhance cooperation with other trade partner countries, including Norway and countries in Latin America and Africa as well as the Western Balkans and Greenland.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_1146\": {\"Why is the Commission presenting this initiative?\": \"The transformation to a sustainable economy is a key political priority of the EU. It is essential for the wellbeing of our society and our planet. Companies play a key role in creating a sustainable and fair economy and society but they need support in the form of a clear framework. EU-level legislation on corporate sustainability due diligence will advance the green transition, and protect human rights in Europe and beyond. In addition to the European Parliament and Council, civil society as well as companies also call for action. Around 70% of companies participating in the 2020 preliminary Study on due diligence as well as the 2021 Open public consultation agreed that a harmonized EU legal framework on due diligence for human rights and environmental impacts is needed. Based on 2020 consumer survey, nearly eight in 10 respondents indicate that sustainability is important for them.\", \"Why is voluntary action by companies not sufficient to address human rights and environmental impacts?\": \"Many companies are already putting in place corporate sustainability tools. For instance, in the 2020 Study on due diligence requirements through the supply chain, a third of respondents from companies across all sectors, said that their companies undertake work in this area, taking into account all human rights and environmental impacts. Such own commitments or voluntary initiatives are laudable, and have helped tackle sustainability problems to a certain extent. However, research shows that when companies take voluntary action, they focus on the first link in the supply chains while human rights and environmental harm occurs more often further down in the value chain. Furthermore, progress is slow and uneven. This is why it is time to have clear rules in place.\", \"What will companies be required to do?\": \"The new proposal sets out a corporate due diligence duty to identify, prevent, bring to an end, mitigate and account for adverse human rights and environmental impacts in the company's own operations, its subsidiaries and their value chains. It builds on the UN's Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and responsible business conduct, and is in line with internationally recognised human rights and labour standards. In practice, the new proposal will require the companies within its scope to: Integrate due diligence into policies.Identify actual or potential adverse human rights and environmental impacts.Prevent or mitigate potential impacts.Bring to an end or minimise actual impacts.Establish and maintain a complaints procedure.Monitor the effectiveness of the due diligence policy and measures.Publicly communicate on due diligence. In order to achieve a meaningful contribution to the sustainability transition, due diligence under this Directive should be carried out with respect to all adverse human rights and environmental impacts identified in its Annex. This means that companies must take appropriate measures to prevent, end or mitigate impacts on the rights and prohibitions included in international human rights agreements, for example, regarding workers' access to adequate food, clothing, and water and sanitation in the workplace. Companies are also required to take measures to prevent, end or mitigate negative environmental impacts that run contrary to a number of multilateral environmental conventions. In addition, the new proposal requires certain large companies to adopt a plan to ensure that their business strategy is compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5 \\u00b0C in line with the Paris Agreement.\", \"What are directors obliged to do and how will their duties be enforced?\": \"The Directive also introduces duties for the directors of the EU companies that it covers. These duties include setting up and overseeing the implementation of the due diligence processes and integrating due diligence into the corporate strategy. In addition, when directors act in the interest of the company, they must take into account the human rights, climate and environmental consequences of their decisions and the likely consequences of any decision in the long term. Companies have to duly take into account the fulfilment of the obligations regarding the corporate climate change plan when setting any variable remuneration linked to the contribution of a director to the company's business strategy and long-term interests and sustainability. The rules on directors' duties are enforced through existing Member States' laws.\", \"Will all companies be affected by these rules?\": \"The new rules will only apply to large limited liability companies with substantial economic strength. Small and Medium Enterprises are excluded from the direct scope. This is about companies with 500+ employees and a net turnover over \\u20ac150 million worldwide. 2 years after the new rules start applying, new rules will also be extended to other limited liability companies with 250+ employees and a net turnover over \\u20ac40 million worldwide, in sectors where a high-risk of human rights violations or harm to the environment has been identified, e.g. in agriculture, textiles or minerals. The Directive will also apply to non-EU companies active in the EU with a turnover threshold aligned with the above, generated in the EU.\", \"Will SMEs be affected by the new rules?\": \"SMEs do not fall under the scope of the Directive. Nevertheless, they might be indirectly affected by the new rules as a result of the effect of large companies' actions across their value chains. Therefore, the proposal foresees specific support addressed to SMEs, such as guidance and other tools to help them gradually integrate sustainability considerations in their business operations. Member States shall provide further technical support, and may provide financial support to SMEs to facilitate adaptation. The proposal will also contain elements to protect SMEs from excessive requirements from large companies.\", \"What happens if companies do not comply with the new rules?\": \"Member States will supervise that companies comply with their due diligence obligations. Member States could impose fines to companies, or issue orders requiring the company to comply with the due diligence obligation. It is particularly important to enable victims to obtain compensation for damage. Therefore, the proposal will also give those affected by harm the opportunity to hold companies to account. This means that victims will have the possibility to bring a civil liability claim before the competent national courts. Such civil liability concerns companies' own operations and its subsidiaries and established business relationships with which a company cooperates on a regular and frequent basis, where the harm could have been identified, and prevented or mitigated, with appropriate due diligence measures.\", \"How will effective enforcement be ensured?\": \"Member States will designate an authority to ensure effective enforcement. The Directive also requires Member States to adapt their rules on civil liability to cover cases where damage results from failure by a company to comply with due diligence obligations, building on their existing regimes on civil liability. At European level, the Commission will set up a European Network of Supervisory Authorities that will bring together representatives of the national bodies, in order to ensure a coordinated approach and enable knowledge and experience sharing.\", \"What are the benefits for citizens?\": \"Citizens will become more aware of the impact of the products they buy and services they use. The main benefits will be the following: More transparency and reliability on how products are made and services delivered.Protection of human rights \\u2013 sustainable business models have to prevent human rights abuses.Healthier environment and a longer-term commitment to the environment from companies. Citizens could also feel more motivated to protect the environment, knowing that they are not alone in their efforts and companies are doing their share as well.\", \"What are the benefits for companies?\": \"For the first time ever, companies operating in the EU market will have common and clear rules on corporate sustainability due diligence.  The main benefits will be the following: Preventing legal fragmentation. Some EU countries have developed national rules (such as France, Germany or the Netherlands) or want to do so (e.g. Austria, Belgium, Finland, Denmark) but the scope of these measures varies a lot from one country to the other. Moreover, there are many voluntary initiatives in place. This causes legal uncertainty for companies across the EU.Meeting consumers' expectations. Consumers are drawn increasingly to products made in an ethically and environmentally sustainable way, for example, without using harmful substances. They also perceive greater benefit and value from products sold by a socially responsible company, like ethical cocoa.Meeting investor expectations. Investors prompt transparency requirements. Without mandatory action, investors and consumers would miss consistent benchmarks to be assured about the value chain standards.Reinforcing risk management. Thanks to the new rules, companies will have a clearer view of their operations and supply chain, including higher awareness of their negative impacts, and will be able to detect problems and risks (including reputational risks) early.Generating economic benefits. Research shows that companies which incorporate sustainability factors into their policy generate higher returns.Increasing resilience. Researchers found that companies which had integrated social, environmental and health considerations into their strategies weathered the COVID-19 crisis better and saw a milder drop in stock prices during the pandemic than those who had not.\", \"What are the costs for companies?\": \"The new rules on due diligence will apply to companies of significant size and economic strength and those operating in high impact sectors such as textiles, agriculture, extraction of minerals. While SMEs are not subject to direct obligations in the proposal, accompanying measures will support SMEs that may be indirectly affected. In order to comply with the new rules, companies may incur costs related to establishing and operating due diligence processes and procedures. In addition, companies may also incur additional transition costs from investments needed to change their own operations and value chains to address adverse impacts.\", \"How will this proposal ensure EU companies remain competitive?\": \"Companies' competitiveness increasingly relies on their ability to ensure sustainable practices all along their value chains. Consumers are more and more aware of the choices they make with their purchases, raising demands for sustainable and responsibly sourced products and services. At the same time, investors are also increasingly considering businesses' sustainability when looking for new investment opportunities. The varying existing and planned national due diligence rules as well as numerous voluntary initiatives cause legal uncertainty for companies across the EU, fragmentation of the Single market, additional costs and complexity. The proposal therefore aims to provide a harmonised, clear and coherent framework. It will also potentially become a model worldwide on sustainable value chains. By helping companies better address the impacts in their value chains, the proposal will not only improve companies' competitiveness, but also their efficiency and financial performance, preparedness and long-term resilience.\", \"What is the impact of the new rules on developing countries?\": \"The new rules will bring multiple benefits for developing countries, including a better protection of human rights and the environment, better adoption of international standards and facilitation of better access to remedies for victims of harmful corporate practices. The proposal should achieve the most significant positive impacts in the EU's main trading partners in developing countries. The Commission looks forward to working further with EU trading partners to ensure mutually reinforcing initiatives, including development of voluntary sustainability standards, support of multi-stakeholder alliances and industry coalitions, as well as accompanying support provided through EU development policy and other international cooperation instruments. The proposal also aims to address potential negative effects on trading partners in developing countries, which could include companies withdrawing from very risky territories if they cannot mitigate harm due to systemic issues. In this regard, the proposal contains accompanying measures, such as capacity-building support for SMEs with a view to mitigating such possible impacts. The aim is to make clear that companies should prioritise engagement with business relationships in the value chain, instead of disengaging, which should stay a last resort.\", \"Are there international standards on corporate sustainability due diligence?\": \"2011 United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights state that companies should avoid infringing the human rights of others and should address adverse human rights impacts with which they are involved in their own operations and through their direct and indirect business relationships. The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, related Guidance on Responsible Business Conduct and sectoral guidance specify and further develop this concept of due diligence. The recommendations of the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy also embed this concept. The OECD framework extended the application of due diligence to cover environmental harm.\", \"What are examples of mitigating measures?\": \"The Commission has conducted a comprehensive mapping of existing EU-funded actions whose objectives and results are accompanying the implementation of the Directive. The mapping identified about 75 relevant ongoing Commission actions.  An example of such action is the garment traceability project with UNECE and ITC. This project provides tools for companies that are immediately relevant for their due diligence obligations.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_865\": {}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_922\": {\"Why is the Commission proposing a Secure Connectivity initiative?\": \"The functioning of our economy and our security is increasingly dependent on secure and resilient connectivity. Digital hyper-connectivity and technological transformation prompt an unprecedented increase of demand for services dependent on edge technologies. There is also an unprecedented demand for satellite communication services, whereas the new technological advancements set new requirements for the security of our communication systems and have led to the emergence of low latency solutions. Spurred by this technological progress, we see the emergence of various public-supported or subsidised non-EU mega-constellations in the US, China and Russia, among others. At the same time, the geopolitical context, cyber and hybrid threats further prompt security and resilience concerns. There is thus mismatch between these rapidly evolving governmental needs and the available EU solutions, both at national and European level, in secure, reliable and diverse satellite communication services, notably enabled by the technological advances derived from Medium and Low Earth orbits. These security-related solutions should be European to ensure guaranteed access in an unrestricted manner, by avoiding dependencies on third-counties and reinforcing the resilience of our value chains. At the same time, there is shortage of available frequency filings and orbital slots due to the dramatic increase of mega-constellations. Absence of timely action at EU level would also endanger the competitiveness of EU industry in key technologies and markets. The initiative will benefit from the expertise of the European industrial space industry, both from the well-established industrial players as well the New Space ecosystem. Global satellite connectivity has thus now become a strategic asset for security, safety and resilience of the EU and its Member States.\", \"What is this initiative expected to achieve?\": \"This proposal aims to develop a secure and autonomous space-based connectivity system for the provision of guaranteed and resilient satellite communications, in particular to: Ensure the long-term availability to governmental users of worldwide reliable, secure and cost-effective satellite communications services that support protection of critical infrastructures, surveillance, external actions and crisis management, thereby increasing the resilience of Member States;Allow commercial high-speed broadband availability throughout Europe, removing dead zones and ensuring cohesion across Member State territories, and provide connectivity over geographical areas of strategic interest, such as Africa and the Arctic region. In particular, the objectives of the initiative are to: develop, build and operate a multi-orbital space-based state-of-the-art connectivity system, continuously adapted to governmental satellite communications demand evolution, taking into account the existing and future assets of the Member States;complement the Union pool of satellite communication capacities and services and integrate the GOVSATCOM ground segment infrastructure referred to in Article 67 of Regulation (EU) 2021/696;contribute to cyber resilience against cyber and electromagnetic threats  and operational cybersecurity, and integrate the European quantum communication space infrastructure (EuroQCI) to enable secure transmission of cryptographic keys;improve the resilience of the Union's telecommunication infrastructures;improve and expand the capabilities and services of other components of the Union Space Programme;incentivise the development of innovative and disruptive technologies, and use the New Space ecosystem; andcreate an environment favourable to the further development of high-speed broadband and seamless connectivity throughout Europe. An important aspect is the complementarity of the initiative with the existing terrestrial connectivity infrastructures, adding the \\u2018last mile' and offering a high degree of redundancy.\", \"What are the practical applications of the system?\": \"This initiative will offer mobile and fixed broadband satellite access, satellite trunking for B2B services, Satellite access for transportation, reinforced networks by satellite and satellite broadband and cloud-based services. It can support edge computing, Internet of Things, autonomous driving, e-health, smart working and education, in-flight and maritime connectivity, and smart agriculture. Uses expand beyond these, in three main pillars: (i) surveillance, (ii) crisis management; (iii) connection and protection of key infrastructures. Here are some examples: (i) border, maritime and remote areas surveillance; Remote Piloted Aircraft Systems; Arctic region coverage; space surveillance, and complement to military missions; (ii) civil protection; CFSP/CSDP and national missions; humanitarian aid; telemedicine; and maritime emergencies of search and rescue; (iii) institutional secure comm. like Embassies, EUROPOL et al; management of air, road and rail infrastructures; command and control of smart grids in energy, finance, health et al; Galileo enhancement and Copernicus data relay.\", \"What is the novelty compared to existing systems?\": \"Governments, citizens and EU institutions are becoming increasingly dependent on connectivity. Their increasing and evolving needs require higher security solutions, low latency and higher bandwidth hence the need to have guaranteed access to resilient solutions through innovative technology, including from the New Space ecosystem. The envisaged system will thus be a technology-setter. Security will be one of the main difference, relying on quantum cryptography through the EuroQCI, and enhanced cybersecurity through a secure-by-design approach for the infrastructure. Another important difference with, for instance GOVSATCOM, lies in the exploitation of multi-orbital derived capabilities, notably from new LEO satellites that can address both (i) the qualitative needs of low-latency and (ii) global coverage.\", \"What is the timeline of the initiative?\": \"The establishment of the Programme will follow a gradual approach striving for quality. Initial development and deployment could start as of 2023; provision of initial services and in-orbit test of quantum cryptography by 2025; and full deployment with the integrated quantum cryptography allowing full services by 2028.\", \"Which are the budgetary implications?\": \"Total cost is estimated at \\u20ac6 billion. The Union's contribution to the Programme from 2022 until 2027 is \\u20ac2,4 billion at current prices. The funding will come from different sources of the public sector (EU budget, Member States and ESA contributions) and private sector investments. Regarding the EU funding, it will be engineered in a fashion that it does not undermine the implementation of existing space components of the EU Space Regulation, notably Galileo and Copernicus.\", \"How? What are the options for implementation?\": \"A public-private partnership (PPP) is the preferred option since the direct involvement of the private sector provides, on the one hand, the secure, resilient and innovative governmental services required, and on the other hand, creates an environment favourable to the further development of high-speed broadband and seamless connectivity throughout Europe, removing communication dead zones and ensuring cohesion across Member State territories as well as providing connectivity over geographical areas of strategic interest, i.e. Africa and the Arctic region . Through a competitive procurement process, the Commission may conclude a concession contract to deliver the solution required and protect the Union and Member States interests. The involvement of industry through a PPP allows the private partner to complement the Programme infrastructure with additional capabilities through additional own investments. It is important to pay attention to the fact that the satellite communication market for commercial services is already well established. The Commission will therefore be paying particular attention within the PPP to not crowd out commercial investments and the contractual terms would reflect the degree of risk taken by the private sector. The role of the public sector will be adequately reflected in the future governance, with special attention to the security of the infrastructure and strong control of cost, schedule and performance. The Commission will be the Programme Manager for the establishment, and the supervision of the concession. The EU agency of the Space Programme will be entrusted with the provision of the governmental services, and the European Space Agency will be entrusted with the supervision of the development and validation activities.\", \"What are the benefits of a public-private partnership (PPP)?\": \"Main benefits comprise: optimisation of cost, i.e. the acquisition of a system at a lower cost, the Union sharing the design, development and deployment risks with the private operator;the competition's enabling  innovative solutions during the concession process, notably through the involvement of the New Space industrial ecosystem, and enhancing the competitiveness of the EU industry. In order to ensure the security and availability of the governmental services, the Union will own the part of the system infrastructure related to security.the concessionaire(s) exploiting the system for commercial services too, thereby creating additional benefits for the downstream sector; sharing development and deployment costs on components common to both governmental and commercial infrastructures, as well as operational costs, creates a high capacity mutualisation. European citizens would also benefit from the enhanced operational performance of the type, variety and quality of services offered.\", \"How will businesses, SMEs and micro-enterprises be involved?\": \"The space industry, including New Space, will be fostering innovation on upstream space technologies, launchers, and downstream applications that will allow them to increase their global competitiveness. New Space industry will be able to participate through technology innovation during the development and deployment of the programme, service provision possible during exploitation through the concession contract. The procurement should also ensure effective and transparent competition, reinforce the autonomy of the EU in technological terms, and ensure compliance with requirements related to security, service continuity and reliability. The involvement of the digital industry is also very important. The exploitation of such a system will allow telecommunication operators to benefit from the increased capacity and reliable and secure services. In addition, the commercial dimension will allow retail services to reach more private users across the entire EU. All other businesses will benefit from secure and reliable connectivity, enabling them to provide new services, less vulnerable to cyber threats and service disruptions.\", \"Can non-EU parties participate in the initiative?\": \"In line with the objective to provide secure governmental satellite communication services, the envisaged EU space-based secure connectivity system will be a strategic asset with geopolitical implications. It aims at reducing European dependency on non-European solutions. The governmental user needs require, a guaranteed access in an unrestricted manner to secure connectivity services. Therefore, any critical dependence on non-EU satellite communication infrastructure would be detrimental to the integrity, resilience and sustainability of the Union's operations. Participation in the Programme can be open to third countries or an international organisation on the basis of concluding an international agreement (Article 218 TFEU). There are detailed provisions governing such participation depending on the link these third countries have established with the Union. In principle, third countries and international organisations may have access to the Union secure connectivity services if they conclude an international agreement (Article 218 TFEU) and they comply with protection of classified information enshrined in the Union's Space Regulation (Article 43).

This is a Commission contribution to the Strategic Compass on Security and Defence that is currently being discussed by the Member States. A stronger EU on Security and Defence also reinforces NATO. It follows the announcements by President von der Leyen on Defence in her State of the Union Speech 2021 as well as the by the European Council of 26 February 2021.\", \"How will these initiatives benefit the EU?\": \"The European Union needs to act now to strengthen its defence capabilities in the present context and enable the EU to face present and future threats, with a new generation of state-of-the-art technologies, such as: cyber, hybrid, space collaborative and autonomous systems based on connectivity and Artificial Intelligence (AI). At the same time, the industrial ecosystem that defence forms together with the aerospace and the security sector constitutes a high-tech industrial ecosystem that is not only an essential driver for Europe's open strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty, but also a major contributor to growth and innovation. On top of contributing to the security of the European Union's citizen, the European defence sector contributes significantly to the sustainable economic recovery following the pandemic and given its overall innovative nature, the defence ecosystem also has the potential of greatly contributing to the green transition and result in positive spill-overs for civilian use. Communication \\u201cCommission contribution to European defence\\u201d\", \"How will investments for defence research and capabilities developed in EU cooperative frameworks be stepped up?\": \"The European Defence Fund (EDF), with a budget close to \\u20ac8 billion for 2021-27, is already a game-changer in supporting collaborative defence research and development projects meeting EU armed forces' operational needs. By the end of 2022, the EDF will have invested \\u20ac1.9 billion in such projects to be implemented by consortia of defence companies \\u2013 entities \\u2013 belonging to several different Member States. Joint procurement can significantly enhance interoperability between armed forces. However, Member states still collectively fail to meet the longstanding benchmark of 35% of their total defence equipment dedicated to procurement in cooperation with other Member States. In order to address this negative trend, the defence package explores new options: By early 2023, the Commission will propose a VAT waiver to support the joint procurement and ownership of defence capabilities developed in a collaborative way within the EU, while ensuring compliance with World Trade Organisation rules.By mid-2023, the Commission will build on the work of the Expert Group of the Financial Toolbox with a view to propose new financing solutions to facilitate Member States' joint procurement of EU strategic defence capability priorities building upon already available expertise.Following the interim evaluation of the EDF, the Commission will consider a possible amendment to article 13 of Regulation 2021/697 establishing the European Defence Fund, to reinforce the EDF bonus system when Member States are able to commit to jointly acquire and/or own the developed capabilities. The Commission will present observations on developments, barriers and opportunities related to multinational defence capabilities projects in the Annual Single Market Report, usually published with the European Semester Autumn package. While Member States are in charge of issuing export licences for military equipment, the Commission invites them to bring forward ongoing work to streamline and gradually converge arms export control practices, especially for those defence capabilities that are jointly developed, in particular in an EU framework. The Commission invites Member States to seek an approach according to which, in principle, they would respectively not restrain each other from exporting to a third country any military equipment and technology developed in cooperation. This work should ensure that EDF-funded products will profit from adequate and competitive access to international markets without prejudice to Member States' sovereign decisions.\", \"Why and how will the defence dimension of space be strengthened at EU level?\": \"Space is a strategic area for EU's freedom of action and security. At the same time, it is an increasingly congested and contested area, marked by a growing power competition. There is an urgent need to tackle these challenges. A new EU space strategy for security and defence, currently under consideration by Member States in the context of the Strategic Compass, should help build a common understanding of space-related risks and threats, develop appropriate responses to react better and faster to crises, strengthen our resilience and make full use of the benefits and opportunities linked to the space domain. The Commission will explore how to further enhance the protection of EU space assets, notably through additional Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) services, improved performance of EU SST and by making full use of the potential of the EU industry. It will promote a \\u2018dual use by design' approach for EU space infrastructures, with a view to offering new resilient services that address governmental needs, including in the area of defence. An appropriate governance for EU space infrastructures will be set up in close coordination with Member States, building on the model of the Galileo public regulated service. Work towards reducing strategic technological dependencies and enhancing the resilience of space infrastructure related supply chains will also be intensified. The Commission and the High-Representative will also explore the possibility of activation of solidarity, mutual assistance and crisis response mechanisms in case of attacks originating from space or threats to space-based assets.\", \"How will cybersecurity be enhanced?\": \"The EU has already put forward ambitious initiatives to protect citizens, businesses and EU interests from malicious cyber activities in the Cybersecurity Strategy of December 2020. A number of important instruments are already in place, notably: the Directive on measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union (NIS);the Cybersecurity Act;the Directive on attacks against information systems;the implementation of the EU toolbox on 5G Cybersecurity;the Radio Equipment Directive;a Recommendation on a \\u2018Blueprint' for a coordinated response to large-scale. cybersecurity incidents and crises;the EU cyber defence policy framework. The Commission has also presented a recommendation for a Joint Cyber Unit (JCU) and has made a proposal to revise the NIS Directive in December 2020, which is now under consideration by the co-legislators. To complement those instruments and further reduce the attack surface and exposure to risk, the security and standardisation of products and services related to information and communication technology should be strengthened. In 2022, the Commission will propose the Cyber Resilience Act to strengthen the security and standardisation of products and services related to information and communication technology. The Commission will work with Member States on stepping up preparedness for large-scale cyber-incidents through enhanced coordination, including identifying potential needs and resources to manage response. Together with the High Representative, it will continue supporting Member States in setting up the JCU, in particular its mutual assistance mechanism, and will encourage civilian military cooperation to facilitate information exchanges and coordination between defence experts and other communities (i.e. civilian, law enforcement and diplomacy). In 2022, a Strategic agenda for the Cybersecurity Competence Centre will be proposed, including on dual use technology and civil-military synergies to be enshrined in a coordinated manner with relevant actors.\", \"How is the impact of the defence sector on climate change addressed?\": \"While maintaining operational effectiveness remains a priority, the defence sector needs to meet the challenge of adapting to the security effects of climate change including operation under more extreme climatic conditions, as well as  contribute to mitigation under the EU's climate change policies, in particular the European Green Deal. Improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions in this sector should become an integral part of the collective efforts towards climate neutrality by 2050 as well as the protection of biodiversity and a strengthened circular economy. \\u20ac133 million have been dedicated to a specific call to support research and development of defence technologies and products addressing these topics. In this context, the Commission is committed to the implementation of the 2020 Joint EU Climate Change and Defence Roadmap on which the Commission will present a first annual progress report together with the EEAS and the EDA in the first half of 2022. As similar work is being stepped up within NATO, the UN and by the United States and other partners, the EU will intensify its staff-to-staff dialogues on climate, security and defence. Roadmap on critical technologies for security and defence\", \"Why are you setting out the \\u2018Roadmap on critical technologies for security and defence' now?\": \"The Roadmap on critical technologies for security and defence responds to a request from the Members of the European Council of 26 February 2021 to outline a path for boosting research, technology development and innovation and reducing the EU's strategic dependencies in critical technologies and value chains for security and defence.\", \"How does this plan link to other initiatives, such as the Action Plan on synergies between civil, defence and space industries?\": \"The roadmap builds on the Updated Industrial Strategy and the Action Plan on synergies between civil, defence and space industries. It proposes to widen the scope of these initiatives by inviting Member States to work more closely with the EU to boost research and innovation and reduce strategic dependencies on critical technologies and value chains, notably to: identify technologies critical for EU security and defence, boosting them through European (RTD&I) programmes;ensurethat defence considerations are better taken into account in civilian European RTD&I programmes and industrial and trade policies, as appropriate, while possible civilian uses of technologies are also better considered in defence RTD&I programmes; promotefrom the outset an EU-wide strategic and coordinated approach for critical technologies for security and defence, to make the best use of EU and Member States' RTD&I programmes, achieve synergies between civilian and defence RTD&I communities and mitigate strategic dependencies from external sources; andcoordinateas much as possible with other like-minded partners, such as the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), under mutually beneficial conditions.\", \"What is the \\u2018Observatory of critical technologies' and what will it do?\": \"The Observatory of critical technologies is currently being set up by the Commission in line with the Action Plan on synergies. The Observatory will identify, monitor and assess critical technologies for the space, defence and related civil sectors, their potential application and related value and supply chains. It will also identify, monitor and analyse existing and predictable technology gaps, root causes of strategic dependencies and vulnerabilities. The Commission, based on data of the Observatory, will present to Member States a classified report on critical technologies and risks associated with strategic dependencies affecting security, space and defence by end of 2022 and every two years thereafter. The Commission will prepare technology roadmaps based on these reports, which will include mitigating measures to boost research and innovation, and reduce strategic dependencies affecting security and defence.\", \"How do you plan to reduce strategic dependencies?\": \"Once critical technologies for defence and security are agreed at EU level, the Commission plans to exploit the full potential of synergies, by embedding defence considerations into EU industrial and technological initiatives. The European Chips Act, considering semiconductors explicitly as a critical sector for defence, is the first example of this new approach. It is also essential that the EU protects better its critical assets. The Commission suggests strengthening the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) screening, by encouraging all Member States to set up a national screening mechanism.\", \"How will the Roadmap assist non-traditional players and existing innovative start-ups and SMEs to engage on critical technologies for security and defence?\": \"The Commission recognised in its Action Plan on synergies the benefits arising from fostering synergies between civilian and defence research and innovation activities for the competitiveness and resilience of the EU's economy and society. The Commission will set up several tools in support of innovation and entrepreneurship on critical technologies for security and defence, notably: a) dedicated EDF actions; b) a new defence investment blending facility under InvestEU; c) a new CASSINI for defence; d) a new innovation incubator on new technologies and dual-use innovation in 2022; and e) increased support to innovation networks. These tools should assist in particular non-traditional players and existing innovative start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with overcoming the high technological, administrative, regulatory and market-entry hurdles of the security and defence sectors, as well as with complying with their high security standards, and accessing financing.\", \"What is the \\u2018Defence Innovation Scheme'?\": \"The Commission, together with the European Defence Agency (EDA), will set up a Defence Innovation Scheme to bring under one umbrella their respective initiatives in support of defence innovation and entrepreneurship. The Commission, based on its experience in implementing the EU budget in support of defence, civil and dual-use RTD&I, will stimulate innovation for the European defence technology and industrial base. EDA and its Defence Innovation Hub will further connect and support Member States efforts based on EDA's defence expertise, including in bringing together emerging and disruptive technologies and military capability requirements.\", \"How does the Roadmap foresee cooperation with international partners?\": \"Cooperating with like-minded partners around the world is essential for enhancing the EU's resilience and security of supply, while reducing strategic dependencies and increasing mutual benefits. The principle of reciprocity plays an important role in this context. The EU's traditional partners in the areas of technology, security and defence include the members of the European Economic Area (in particular Norway), candidate countries, neighbourhood countries, and other third countries (e.g. United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea), as well as international organisations (e.g. NATO). For instance, at the first meeting of the EU-U.S. Trade and Technology Council (TTC) in September 2021, the EU and the US reaffirmed their commitment to \\u2018focus on advancing respective supply chain resilience and security of supply in key sectors for the green and digital transition and for securing the protection of our citizens' and its aim to \\u2018increase transparency of supply and demand; map respective existing sectoral capabilities; exchange information on policy measures and research and development priorities; and cooperate on strategies to promote supply chain resilience and diversification'. Regarding the cooperation with NATO, the Commission and the High-Representative/Vice-President will monitor the progress of relevant NATO initiatives in this area through regular contacts with NATO at working level with a view to possible mutually agreeable and beneficial interaction with relevant EU initiatives in full transparency towards Member States, while avoiding creating new or increasing existing technological or capability dependencies.

STM relates to the following elements: a) Space Situational Awareness (SSA) activities, including SST; b) orbital debris mitigation and remediation; c) management of space orbits and radio spectrum; d) the entire life-cycle of space operations including launch phase, in-orbit operations of spacecraft, and end-of-life de-orbit operations; e) re-entry phase of spacecraft (both controlled and uncontrolled).\", \"What is the main aim of the initiative?\": \"The objective of this Joint Communication of the Commission and the High Representative is to lay out a concrete EU approach on Space Traffic Management (STM) for a safe, sustainable and secure use of space, preserving EU interests in full compliance with the respective competences of the EU and its Member States. In particular, it aims at: giving a working definition of STM;developing STM civil and military requirements;fostering the development of the capabilities to provide Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) services, as STM can be performed only via an efficient SST system;implementing an appropriate framework of standards and rules;promoting the EU STM approach globally.\", \"Why is action needed?\": \"Since the beginning of the space race, about 6,000 launches have put in orbit 11,800 satellites of which 4,550 are currently operational[1], the rest being debris which continue to orbit in space. In the years to come more than 20,000 additional satellites will be launched. Consequently, space is rapidly becoming densely populated with constellations and launch systems. Increasing congestion in space is threatening the viability and safety of space infrastructure and operations. More than 1 million debris items between 1 and 10 cm are orbiting around Earth, a number which is still increasing. At the same time, only very limited global \\u2018rules of the road' on conduct in outer space exist currently. Although there have been notable achievements at UN level, the development of a comprehensive approach at international level is facing considerable diplomatic and political hurdles, which add to the urgency to act.\", \"What has been done at the EU level so far?\": \"At the operational level, the EU is active in the field of Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) since 2014. The EU SST Consortium delivers SST services necessary for the management of space traffic, such as assessing the risk of uncontrolled re-entry or providing information on collision avoidance. Currently, the EU SST Consortium is providing collision avoidance services to more than 260 European spacecraft. At the technical level, two coordination and support actions are currently carried out within the framework of Horizon 2020 assessing the technologies and capacities necessary for the management of space traffic. Furthermore, at the request of the European Parliament, the Commission launched a pilot project on space traffic management. This project aims to provide a comprehensive picture of existing and emerging frameworks and to carry out a prior identification of needs. It also assesses regulatory frameworks and market developments. The Action Plan on Synergies between civil, defence and space industries, adopted in February 2021, established STM as a flagship project aiming to develop STM standards and rules.\", \"What is the value added of action at EU level?\": \"The EU is a space power with cutting-edge satellite navigation services provided by Galileo and EGNOS, and Earth observation services by Copernicus. The proposed actions will enhance the resilience and the safety of EU and Member States' space infrastructure our societies and economies depend on. The EU already promotes a multilateral approach to ensure the preservation of the long-term safety and sustainability of activities in outer space, with the objective of reducing risks for all space systems. The EU is well placed to act, being able to identify needs, requirements, gather views, leverage technology and coordinate external engagement.\", \"How will businesses, SMEs and micro-enterprises be involved?\": \"It is necessary to ensure that the potential offered by EU industry, including New Space, is fully exploited building upon the public services delivered by EU SST. Through targeted actions, the EU SST Partnership can reap the benefits of the EU industry's latest and innovative technological developments. The future improved EU catalogue and the related data-sharing platform will be partially made available to EU companies for research activities to develop added-value derived STM services in Europe and at the international level. More concretely, EU companies are participating through call for tenders published by the members of the EU SST Consortium. As a result, up to 75% of the funds delegated by the EU to the EU SST Consortium are sub-contracted to EU industry. This has already created a European industrial ecosystem around SST that should be in a position also to contribute to the EU STM approach.\", \"What about external engagement in Space Traffic Management?\": \"Space is a global public good of increasing geopolitical importance. It is essential to act collectively. The EU STM approach aims to contribute to a global endeavour, pairing existing regional capabilities and tools with an overall ambition for global cooperation, and will favour a multilateral STM approach in the framework of the United Nations. The EU will pursue an active diplomacy related to STM. Discussions with international partners should focus on civilian matters (e.g. operations, standardisations, etc.), but should also highlight related security and defence aspects of STM.\", \"What are the next steps?\": \"The EU approach for Space Traffic Management proposes ten concrete actions to be carried out between 2022 and 2024 by the Commission and the High Representative in cooperation with the Member States.  Within the next four months, the first action is to set up a consultation process with all relevant stakeholders to assess the needs and impact of STM on the various policy areas of the Union. The specific needs of defence and security will also be considered as a constitutive element of a common strategic culture for the space domain.

More than 470 spacecraft were launched every year in 2017, 2018 and 2019, while only 110 spacecraft were launched on average per year between 2000 and 2013.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_852\": {\"What has been endorsed by the Member States and what are the next steps?\": \"Member States endorsed four legal acts which will simplify the process of approval and authorisation of biological plant protection products which contain micro-organisms. The objective is to provide farmers with tools to substitute chemical plant protection products. These acts reflect the latest scientific developments and are based on the specific biological properties of micro-organisms. Farmers are keen to have access to sustainable solutions to protect crops. By facilitating the placing on the market of these biological plant protection products, farmers \\u2013 including those producing organic crops - will have more alternatives available for sustainable crop protection. With these acts, the Commission is delivering on the objectives of the Farm-to-Fork Strategy. The acts will now be scrutinised by the European Parliament and the Council. If they do not object, they will be adopted and be applicable in Q4 2022.\", \"What are micro-organisms and how can they be used as active substances in plant protection products?\": \"Micro-organisms are bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa. Some of them are parasites or pathogens of insects or other organisms that are pests or cause disease in plants. Because of their biological properties, these micro-organisms have been used world-wide (including in the EU) for decades in biological control of pests and plant diseases. Micro-organisms are naturally occurring in the environment. The strains with the best properties are those used in biological control to fight pests and diseases in crop protection. However, before micro-organism are allowed to be used, it needs to be verified that their use is safe and has no negative consequences for human and animal health or towards other non-target organisms.\", \"How do these new Regulations foster the access to market of micro-organisms used in plant protection products?\": \"So far the requirements for micro-organisms were based on principles which were very similar to those for chemical active substances. The new acts follows a different approach which is based on the biology and ecology of each micro-organism and takes into account the most recent scientific knowledge.In this way the regulatory requirements for micro-organisms are made more \\u2018fit-for-purpose' and flexible. In addition focusing only on relevant data also means less animal testing, because fewer experiments on animals will be required. The biological properties of the micro-organisms play a central role for the risk assessment and many data required in the new implementing acts are conditional to the biology and ecology of the particular micro-organism. In any case, a micro-organism can only be approved for use if it is proven that it does not cause disease in humans or animals. More \\u201cfit for purpose\\u201d and flexible requirements also imply streamlined application dossiers, more straight forward risk assessment, and shorter timelines to get access to the EU market. These new Regulations are based on the most updated science. They make the EU one of the most advanced regulators on the global stage for these products.\", \"How will the use of micro-organisms contribute to the objectives of the Farm to Fork and the Green Deal, in particular for farmers?\": \"The Farm to Fork Strategy and the Green Deal aim at reducing dependency on and use of chemical plant protection products. Micro-organisms used as biocontrol agents in plant protection products provide farmers with alternative tools to substitute chemical plant protection products. They can also be used in organic agriculture. The new requirements are expected to lead to a faster access to the EU market for micro-organism and plant protection products containing them.\", \"Is it safe to use micro-organisms in agriculture?\": \"Micro-organisms have been used by humans almost as long as humanity exists, for instance for bread, cheese, beer and wine-making purposes. In modern times their uses have been widened. They can be used, for instance, as fundamental components of probiotics of food/feed additives, or for manufacturing medicinal active substances. Micro-organisms are naturally-occurring and most of them are harmless.  Many of them play key roles in the ecosystems, for instance by decomposing organic matter in the soil to make it available for other organisms, or by enriching the soil with atmospheric nitrogen (\\u201cnitrogen fixation\\u201d) to make it available for plants. Micro-organisms, like all the other active substances used in plant protection products (PPPs), can only be approved for use if they fulfil the approval criteria laid down in the Regulation on placing on the market of PPPs. The Member States, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the Commission evaluate every active substance for safety for humans and the environment before it can be placed on the market and used in a plant protection product. In a 2nd regulatory step, Member States authorise each plant protection product containing approved active substances for the intended use. Currently more than 60 micro-organisms are approved in EU after a scientific risk assessment confirmed that their use in plant protection products is safe.\", \"Viruses can also be approved. Is this safe?\": \"Several viruses that are highly specific for insects or plants are currently approved in the EU for plant protection purposes and have been proven to be safe since many years. Because they are highly specific towards a narrow group of plant pests, they cannot infect humans or other organisms which are not plant pests. It is important to underline that viruses, like other micro-organisms, will not be approved if they cause disease in humans. The Member States and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)evaluate their safety for human health and the environment before approval  .\", \"Are plant protection products (PPPs) containing micro-organisms as efficacious as chemicals?\": \"Biological plant protection products containing micro-organisms may be less efficient than chemicals, for instance because of their narrow host range and because as living organisms they require optimal conditions to successfully control the pests. This makes them also inherently safer than chemicals. However, the use of such biological alternatives plays a key role in organic farming where farmers can use micro-organism as biological control agents. Micro-organisms are also crucial for Integrated Pest Management (IPM), which farmers have to use in the EU. Farmers must give preference to preventive actions, monitoring and biological plant protection alternatives (including micro-organisms based products), before using chemical plant protection products. IPM also aims to keep the use of pesticides and other forms of intervention only to levels that are economically and ecologically justified, and other measures like crop rotation, selection of appropriate cultivars and cultivation techniques could also be used.\", \"Will this have an impact on organic farming?\": \"Organic farming is a key sector for EU agriculture. In 2019 there were almost 330.000 organic farmers in EU, reaching up to 20% share of farming area in Member States. In addition, one of the targets of the Farm to Fork Strategy concerns the increase the total farmland under organic farming in EU, with at least 25% of the EU's agricultural land to be under organic farming by 2030. Biological plant protection products can be used in organic agriculture. The new Regulations will fasten the access to market for micro-organisms used in biological plant protection products and thus make new sustainable alternatives available to EU organic farmers for controlling plant pests.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_763\": {\"What is the Cohesion Report?\": \"Every three years, in accordance with the Treaty provisions, the Commission publishes a Cohesion Report that provides a comprehensive picture of the state of social, economic and territorial cohesion in the EU. It uses a wide range of indicators, such as prosperity, employment, education levels, accessibility and governance. The Cohesion Report captures the developments over the last years and highlights existing gaps and areas of improvement for the coming years. It also indicates how Cohesion policy supports EU regions to promote sustainable development and overcome their challenges.\", \"What are the main issues covered by the report?\": \"The first seven chapters of the 8th Cohesion Report analyse how regional disparities have evolved in recent years (preliminary impact of the pandemic, economic disparities, environment, transport, employment, demography, governance). The eighth chapter covers national policies, with a focus on public investment. The last chapter focuses on the link between Cohesion policy and other EU policies (Common Agricultural Policy, Horizon Europe and Connecting Europe Facility).\", \"What are the main findings of the report?\": \"The report shows that Cohesion policy has boosted growth in less developed regions. Thanks to Cohesion policy investments in the 2014-2020 period, the GDP per capita of less developed regions is expected to increase by up to 5% by 2023. The same investments also supported a 3.5% reduction in the gap between the GDP per capita of the 10% least developed regions and the 10% most developed regions. Moreover, over time Cohesion policy has become a more important source of public investments. During the 2007-2013 programming period, the amount of Cohesion policy investment was the equivalent of 34% of total public investment in less and moderately developed Member States. In the 2014-2020 period this percentage increased to 52%. Other key findings of the report: Economic disparities Since 2001, less developed regions in Eastern Europe have been catching up with the rest of the EU, leading to a substantial reduction of the GDP per capita gap. At the same time however, many middle-income and less developed regions, especially in the southern and south-western EU, have suffered from economic stagnation or decline. Many were hit by the economic and financial crisis in 2008 and have struggled to recover since. Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic Excess mortality between March 2020 and late 2021 was significantly higher in less developed regions (17%) than in more developed regions (12%) and transition regions (11%). The economic impact of the pandemic was the highest in the southern regions with an economy more dependent on tourism and proximity services. Compared to 2019, the nights spent by tourists dropped by 90% in the months after March 2020. Green transition Available data suggests that the EU has met its 2020 target of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emission by -20% compared to 1990 levels, but significantly more efforts will be needed to reach the 2030 target of -55%. Between 1990 and 2018, GHG emissions increased in several EU regions. Only 40% of EU water bodies were in a good ecological state in 2019. Despite significant progress, several less developed regions still need important investment in wastewater treatment. Air pollution has dropped significantly in the EU. Nevertheless, exposure to air pollutants is still too high in many cities. One out of three city residents are exposed to one or more air pollutants above the EU thresholds. Digital transition Broadband connections are slower in less developed regions and rural areas. For example, while 2 in 3 city residents have access to very high-speed broadband, only 1 in 6 rural residents does. Businesses in less developed Member States are less likely to use e-commerce and e-business technologies. Businesses in more developed countries are twice as likely to use cloud computing or have significant e-commerce sales as compared to those in less developed Member States. Education In less developed regions, adult participation in education and training is less than half that of more developed regions (5% vs 12%). Young adults are more likely to leave education and training early in less developed regions (12%) than in more developed regions (9%). Tertiary education has been growing in all regions, but the gap between more and less developed regions remains wide. Employment The EU employment rate is higher today than before the 2008 economic crisis, but not all regions have fully recovered. Regional disparities are still higher than before the economic crisis. In less developed regions, employment rates are 10 percentage points lower than in more developed regions. This gap has not shrunk between 2013 and 2020. Gender equality In less developed regions, women are faced with a bigger disadvantage compared to men. For example, the gender gap in employment rates is almost double in less developed regions (17 percentage points) compared to more developed regions (9 percentage points). Over time, more women have been elected to local, regional and national positions. Nonetheless, in 2020 still only one in three position was held by a woman. In eastern regions, the share of women in regional assemblies is particularly low: in several regions, their share is below 10%. Demographics The EU population is ageing and will start shrinking in the years to come. In 2020, 34% of the EU population lived in a shrinking region. This is projected to reach 51% in 2040. All regions will have to adjust to a growing population aged 65 and over and a shrinking working age and younger population. Governance The business environment, which includes, for example, the procedures and costs of setting up a business and obtaining the necessary permits, improved in all EU Member States, but significant differences between and within Member States remain. Rural regions and areas Rural regions have an older population and are more likely to have a shrinking population. In 2020, 62% of the rural population lived in a shrinking region compared to only 15% of the urban population. In the eastern EU, life expectancy is lower in rural regions than in urban ones. In the rest of the EU, rural life expectancy is equal or higher than urban life expectancy. Eastern rural areas tend to have higher at risk of poverty and social exclusion rates than cities, while the opposite is true in the north-western EU. Satisfaction with life, job opportunities and financial situation, follow a similar pattern. In the southern EU, the situation is mixed: in some cases rural areas perform better, while in others cities do. Outermost regions In 2019, all the outermost regions had a GDP per head below 75% of the EU average (except Madeira, 76%). In Guyane and Mayotte, GDP per capita was below 50% of the EU average. All the outermost regions had an employment rate below the EU average in 2020. It was below 50% in Guyane and Mayotte. Demographic change in the outermost regions is varied. Half of the regions have a growing population, whereas the rest is shrinking. In Guadeloupe and Martinique the population is shrinking rapidly, while in Acores and Madeira the reduction is slower. Conversely, in La Re\\u0301union and Canarias, the population grew more than twice as fast as the EU average. In Guyane and Mayotte, the population grew more than 10 times faster than the EU.\", \"What are the main challenges of EU regions identified by the report?\": \"Internal territorial disparities have been widening in fast growing Member States, with significantly higher growth in the capital region and other metropolitan regions;Several middle-income and less developed regions, especially in southern and south-western Europe, have suffered from relative economic decline and are stuck in a development trap with extended periods of low productivity and employment growth, due to insufficient regional innovation performance;Demographic change is affecting most of the EU regions. For example, the working age population will shrink by more than 10% in 1 out of 4 regions. This trend weakens growth potential and skills development, while favouring the concentration of economic activities in fewer locations.The regional innovation divide in the EU has increased. Many regions are lagging behind, due to insufficient investment in research and development and weaknesses in regional innovation ecosystems.The risk of poverty and social exclusion remains high. While 17 million people were lifted out of poverty and social exclusion between 2012 and 2019, still more than 1 in 5 persons in the EU are at risk of poverty or social exclusion. Pockets of deprivation persist even in prosperous regions.\", \"What are the main conclusions of the report?\": \"Less developed Eastern EU regions have been catching up with the rest of the EU, leading to a substantial reduction of the GDP per capita gap. This is due to a structural transformation, notably a shift of employment out of agriculture and into higher value-added sectors. Nevertheless, many less developed and transition regions in Southern and South-western Europe experienced stagnation or relative decline and are stuck in a development trap. They have struggled to recovery from the 2008 crisis and will need reforms of the public sector, an upskilled labour force and a stronger capacity to innovate. To tackle the demographic change and the aging population, companies will have to adapt to a shrinking labour force by recruiting more from groups with lower employment rates such as youth, women and non-EU migrants, and by investing more in innovation, and in training, in particular of older and low-skilled workers. Primary and secondary schools will have to adjust to the lower number of pupils, while other public services and healthcare will need to serve a growing number of older residents. Employment has been growing, but differences between regions remain larger than before 2008. The employment rate in less developed regions is still far below the one in more developed regions (66% vs 76%). Furthermore, in less developed regions the gender employment gap is almost twice that of more developed regions. Disparities in education and skills are also visible between urban and rural areas. To increase employment rates, less developed regions should facilitate employment growth and reduce the employment gap of women and youth. Furthermore, despite improvements, less developed regions continue to lag behind in tertiary education, life-long learning and digital skills. The number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion has dropped between 2012 and 2019 by 17 million, but the coronavirus pandemic put an additional 5 million people at risk of poverty or social exclusion. As the EU emerges from the pandemic crisis, efforts must be made to continue the previous trend of poverty reduction. Health disparities between regions have been shrinking, with life expectancy increasing quickly in less developed regions. However, the latter are still behind the EU average. Air and water pollution remain high in several less developed regions. The green transition will boost employment and growth in renewable energy, recycling, design, renovation and ecosystem services, but it may adversely affect sectors that need to transform to reduce their emissions and the regions in which they are located. Such regions should be supported in the transition with ad hoc instruments, such as the Just Transition Fund. Road and rail transport infrastructure improved in the EU. However, some gaps remain and more investments in transport infrastructure are needed, in particular in Eastern regions. Basic broadband access is almost universal in the EU, but very-high-speed connections are only available to 2 out of 3 city residents and 1 out of 6 rural residents. More investments in internet infrastructure, digital technologies, e-commerce and e-business practices are needed to improve online services in rural areas and less developed regions. Entrepreneurship and innovation are essential for economic growth, but regions fare differently. Better scores in entrepreneurship are noted in larger cities, while other areas could improve through upskilling, reskilling and entrepreneurial support. In terms of innovation, many regions, including in more developed Member States, lag behind due to a lack of investment in research and development and weaknesses in regional innovation ecosystems. Support must focus on better innovation diffusion at national and regional level, the creation of smart specialisation strategies at regional level and spill-overs from international trade linkages and value chains. Governance in the EU is improving, but gaps remain between and within Member States. Improving institutions can contribute to more effective investment, higher levels of innovation and entrepreneurship. All Member States have improved their business environment, but differences remain. The effectiveness of the justice system also differs between Member States and in a few Member States the rule of law has deteriorated over time.\", \"How will 2021-2027 Cohesion policy help tackle the challenges ahead?\": \"In the new programming period 2021-2027, Cohesion policy will continue supporting all EU regions to tackle the challenges ahead, for example: By supporting territories most affected by the socioeconomic impact of the transition to climate neutrality thanks, also, to the Just Transition Fund.By investing in the digital transition to expand very-high-speed internet access, boost digital skills and invest in IT equipment.By tackling demographic challenges thanks to the new policy objective \\u201cA Europe closer to citizens\\u201d, which will encourage the implementation of long-term strategies through the involvement of local actors.By paying a greater attention to regions falling \\u2013 or at the risk of falling \\u2013 into development traps, in particular by fostering innovation with smart specialisation strategies.By becoming more flexible. Drawing the lessons from the coronavirus pandemic, Cohesion policy will be even more adaptable to a changing environment and unexpected shocks, allowing for a higher flexibility in terms of transferring resources, planning and extending capacity to address future crises.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_730\": {\"Why a European Chips Act?\": \"Semiconductor chips are the essential building blocks of digital and digitised products. From smartphones and cars, through critical applications and infrastructures for healthcare, energy, communications and industrial automation, chips are central to the modern digital economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed a weakness in the eco-system within both Europe and other regions in the world experiencing significant shortages of chips. EU industries manufacture many types of high-tech products, of which chips are essential parts. Europe must reinforce its capabilities in semiconductors to ensure future competitiveness and maintain its technological leadership and security of supply. The sector is both capital and knowledge intensive and chips supply chains are global, complex and currently rely on a few manufacturing sites.\", \"What is Europe's current situation in the chips market?\": \"Europe has many strengths and some weaknesses in the semiconductor value chain. The semiconductor sector is characterised by intense R&D activity, with first-class companies reinvesting more than 15% of their revenues into research in next generation technologies. The EU is home to world-leading research and technology organisations  and many excellent universities and research institutes spread across the Union. These are pioneering the techniques behind the production of some of the world's most advanced chips. Moreover, Europe is very well positioned in terms of the materials and equipment needed to run large chip manufacturing plants, with many companies playing essential roles along the supply chain. Despite these strengths, Europe has an overall global semiconductors production market share of less than 10% and is heavily dependent on third-country suppliers. In case of severe disruption of the global supply chain, Europe's chips' reserves in some industrial sectors (e.g. automotive or healthcare devices) could run out in a few weeks, bringing many European industries to a standstill. As the digital transformation accelerates and penetrates every part of society, industrial needs for chips are set to increase, opening new market opportunities.\", \"How has the Commission supported the semiconductors ecosystem so far?\": \"The EU has a history of successful collaboration with industry in the framework of different programmes and actions in Research, Development & Innovation (R&D&I) in semiconductors e.g. in relevant Joint Undertakings, i.e. Public-Private Partnerships for research, development and innovation such as ECSEL and the Key Digital Technologies partnership (KDT). The European Innovation Council, which supports equity investment in breakthrough innovation, is already investing in creating dynamic and resilient semiconductor ecosystems, as part of its work. Reducing the cost and time of new chip designs, minimising the power consumption and waste generated during manufacturing, making chips faster and more efficient are only a few examples of the EIC funding portfolio. Through its Accelerator scheme, the EIC will reinforce its support to start-ups and SMEs with market creating innovation potential in the semiconductor and quantum technologies sector, and help them mature their innovations and attract investors. A new Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) on Microelectronics and Communication Technologies is currently being prepared by a significant number of Member States. An IPCEI is a State aid tool for Member States allowing public co-financing under the condition that it concerns large integrated cross-border projects to overcome market failures and enable breakthrough innovation in key sectors and technologies, up to first industrial deployment, as well as important infrastructure investments, with positive spill-over effects for the EU economy at large. In addition as regards national R&D&I projects in the semiconductor sector, Member States can and are providing aid under the R&D&I State aid rules, in particular the R&D&I Framework and the corresponding provisions of the General Block Exemption Regulation. Already in July 2021, the Commission launched the Industrial Alliance on Processors and Semiconductors, bringing together businesses, Member State representatives, academia, users, as well as research and technology organisations with the objective to identify current gaps in the production of microchips and the technology developments needed for companies and organisations to thrive, no matter their size. With the Chips Act, the EU is strengthening and further expanding such collaboration within the industry to involve all actors of the value chain, including also the designers and players from the demand side.\", \"What is the European Chips Act package?\": \"The Commission has adopted a Communication, two proposals for a Regulation and a Recommendation. The Communication spells out the European Strategy and rationale behind the package. The European Parliament and the Member States will now discuss the Commission's proposals for a Regulation on a European Chips Act in the ordinary legislative procedure. Once adopted, the Regulation will be directly applicable across the EU. In the meantime, the Member States are encouraged to follow the Recommendation. It sets out a toolbox for monitoring and mitigating disruptions in the chips ecosystem. This includes immediate actions that could be taken if they would be appropriate to help overcome the current shortage, before the Regulation enters into force.\", \"How will the European Chips Act address current problems?\": \"The Chips Act is a unique opportunity for Europe to act jointly across all Member States, to the benefit of the whole of Europe. However, the current chips shortage is a systematic issue with no quick fix. In the short term, the toolbox set out in the Recommendation will immediately enable the coordination between the Member States and the Commission. This will allow to discuss and decide on timely and proportionate crisis response measures, if considered necessary.In the medium term, the Chips Act will strengthen manufacturing activities in the Union and support the scale-up and innovation of the whole value chain, addressing security of supply and a more resilient ecosystem.And, in the long-term, it will maintain Europe's technological leadership while preparing the required technological capabilities that would support transfer of knowledge from the lab to the fab and position Europe as a technology leader in innovative downstream markets.\", \"What is the Chips for Europe Initiative?\": \"This initiative, a major part of the overall Chips Act funding package, will pool together \\u20ac11 billion of public investments up to 2030 from the Union and the Member States, and will leverage considerable private investments. (Other financing activities through a new EU Chips Fund, will support equity for start-ups and scale-ups in the sector, for a projected overall value of \\u20ac2 billion.) The Chips for Europe Initiative aims to reinforce the EU's semiconductor technology and innovation capabilities and ensure Europe's chips technology leadership in the mid- to long-term. It will ensure the deployment across Europe of advanced semiconductor design tools, pilot lines for prototyping the next generation of chips and testing facilities for innovative applications of latest chips technology. It will also build advanced technology and engineering capabilities in quantum chips. The Chips for Europe initiative will be implemented by the Digital Europe and the Horizon Europe programmes, using for most of its actions the new EU Chips Joint Undertaking. Digital Europe supports digital capacity building in key digital domains: this is the case where semiconductor technology underpins performance gains, notably High Performance Computing, Artificial Intelligence, and Cybersecurity, together with skills development and the deployment of digital innovation hubs. The Horizon Europe programme supports intensive pre-competitive research, technology development, and innovation in the area of materials and semiconductors. The initiative will build on Europe's leadership in research, including on the capabilities of its leading research centres and of key production equipment providers and strong users' sectors.\", \"How is the Commission proposing to attract investments to strengthen EU security of supply?\": \"Investment in new advanced production facilities is imperative to safeguard the Union's security of supply, supply chain resilience and ecosystem spillovers and interactions, while generating significant positive impacts to the wider economy. To attract such investments the proposed Regulation provides the definition of two types of facilities to be considered as contributing to Europe's security of supply. Such facilities are the so-called \\u2018Open EU foundries', which are facilities that design and produce components mainly for other industrial players, and the so called \\u2018Integrated Production Facilities', which are factories that design and produce components that serve their own market. Such facilities must be \\u201cfirst of a kind\\u201d in Europe and their operator should commit to continued investments in innovation in the Union's semiconductor sector. The recognition as either type of facility triggers a number of benefits. It allows to have access to fast-track permit granting in the Member States for the construction and operation of the facilities. The recognition as Open EU foundries or Integrated Production Facilities allows prioritised access to pilot lines set up under the proposed Chips for Europe initiative, under certain conditions. In order to reach security of supply in the Union, Member States may offer public support to such facilities, without prejudice of State aid rules. The Commission will take the positive effects of such facilities for the European ecosystem into account for its State aid assessments, where relevant.\", \"How will the Commission assess Member States' public support to chips manufacturing facilities under State aid rules?\": \"Private investment in chips manufacturing facilities may likely require public support. In light of the extremely high barriers to entry and the capital intensity of the sector, as already announced in the Communication on a competition policy fit for new challenges, the Commission may consider to approve aid to such facilities directly under Article 107(3)(c) TFEU. This provision allows the Commission to approve State aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities, if the positive effects of such State aid outweigh its potential negative impact on trade and competition. In its assessment, the Commission has to ensure in particular that the aid must: Have a so called \\u201cincentive effect\\u201d and be necessary. This means that State aid can be granted only to support a project that would not take place in the Union without public support.Be appropriate - meaning that there is no other possible tool that would be less distortive for competition.Be proportionate, and limited to the minimum necessary. Relevant aspects to ensure that the positive effects of State aid outweigh the negative are, among others, that: The facilities will be \\u201cfirst-of a kind\\u201d in Europe, meaning that an equivalent facility does not already exist in Europe. In assessing whether a facility is \\u201cfirst of a kind\\u201d, the Commission will take into account the definition contained in the proposed Chips Act.The supported facility will not crowd out existing or committed private initiatives.The public support covers a maximum of 100% of a proven funding gap, i.e. the minimum amount necessary to make sure such investments take place in Europe. Depending on the merits of each individual case, additional positive effects to offset risks of competition distortion will be considered, such as: A strengthening of the semiconductor value chain, to ensure security of supply for European businesses using chips in their products. The acceptance to satisfy EU priority-rated orders, as also set out in the proposed Chips Act, will play a role in this respect.A positive contribution in terms of attracting qualified workforce to Europe.A positive impact on innovation in Europe, bringing benefits to SMEs and end users. The commitment to invest in innovation, set out in the proposed Chips Act for the recognition of Open EU Foundries and Integrated Production Facilities, will play a role in this respect.\", \"How to address the skills shortage?\": \"Demand for talent in electronics has been increasing in the last 20 years, with the microelectronics industry in Europe being directly responsible for 455,000 high-skilled jobs in 2018. One of the main challenges for the sector is to attract and retain highly skilled talent. The Chips for Europe Initiative will support education, training, skilling and reskilling initiatives. Action will support access to postgraduate programmes in microelectronics, short-term training courses, job placements/traineeships and apprenticeships and training in advanced laboratories. Additionally, the Initiative will support a network of competence centres, located across Europe. The aim is to increase the availability of internships and apprenticeships, raise students' awareness of the opportunities in the field and support dedicated scholarships for masters and PhDs, also aiming at increasing female participation.\", \"What investments are needed?\": \"There are various ways into achieve the objectives of the strategy. Huge investments are required to achieve this ambition. This will require the pooling of investment from the Union, Member States and significant contributions from private investors. The strategy underlying the EU Chips Act will mobilise more than \\u20ac43 billion euros of public and private investments. This public investment includes \\u20ac 11 billion to be directly provided under the Chips for Europe Initiative to finance technology leadership in research, design and manufacturing capacities up to 2030. These investments will complement existing actions in research & innovation in semiconductors such as those from Horizon Europe and the Digital Europe programme as well as additional support already envisaged by Member States (e.g. specific measures in recovery and resilience plans, national or regional funds etc.).\", \"The new Joint Undertaking \\u201cKey Digital Technologies\\u201d just started in December 2021. Why a new one now?\": \"The new generation of Horizon Europe partnerships are flexible to adapt to changing technology, market and policy environment. By changing the mandate of the Key Digital Technologies Joint Undertaking set up under the Single Basic Act, the Commission is responding to urgent needs. The Chips Act is a promising opportunity for a wide range of stakeholders, not only for chip manufacturers but also for user industries, in transport, healthcare, communication, manufacturing, etc. The new Chips Joint Undertaking should be open to the participation of new stakeholders in this respect.\", \"What is the aim of the Recommendation addressed to EU countries?\": \"The Commission encourages the European Council and Parliament to discuss the European Chips Act as soon as possible. In the meantime, Member States are encouraged to work together with the Commission to monitor the semiconductor supply chain and anticipate potential disturbances. Member States gather and provide information on the current state of the semiconductor crisis in their national markets, discuss and adopt appropriate, effective and proportionate measures to address the current shortage on national and Union level. This immediate coordination mechanism can take steps to overcoming the current shortage until the proposal for a Regulation is adopted.\", \"What is being done at international level?\": \"By improving its supply chain security and through its capacity to design and produce powerful and resource-efficient semiconductors, the EU is contributing to the rebalancing of the semiconductors global supply chain. Additionally, the EU has as an overall objective to serve the global demand, which will increase substantially, and to win its share of the growing market. Europe will aim at building balanced semiconductor partnerships with like-minded countries. The aim of these partnerships would be to cooperate on initiatives of mutual interest and ensure continuity of supply in times of crisis. At the same time, the EU should be prepared for possible sudden changes in the political situation or unforeseen crises, which could threaten the EU's security of supply. The crisis response toolbox within the EU Chips Act would give the EU the necessary means to address such situations and, in the last resort, to ensure Europe's overall resilience.\", \"When will the Chips Act enter into force?\": \"The proposed Regulation will be discussed by the European Parliament and the Council. The Commission will assist the co-legislators to reach an agreement as soon as possible.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_662\": {\"Why are standards important?\": \"Standards have played a leading role in creating the EU Single Market and supporting European competitiveness. They help manufacturers to ensure the interoperability of products and services, reduce costs, improve safety and foster innovation. Standards underpin the successful roll-out of important investment projects, like hydrogen or batteries.  By valorising innovation investment, they provide a first-mover advantage for EU businesses. As a global standard-setter, the European Union also exports best practices and increases synergies in global value chains. This enhances trade flows and opportunities for European businesses to scale up their activities. EU standards are synonymous with quality around the world.\", \"What are European harmonised standards?\": \"A harmonised European standard is a European standard developed at the request of the Commission by one of the European standardisation organisations (ESOs), in view of applying Union harmonisation legislation. Harmonised EU standards provide the technical specifications needed for a product to respect EU law. They complement and specify the requirements of the respective EU harmonised legislation. Compliance with a harmonised standard grants products the presumption of conformity with the relevant legislation. This allows manufacturers to access the EU market. The list of harmonised standards is regularly updated and published in the Official Journal of the EU. Currently, more than 3600 references to harmonised standards are published in the Official Journal of the EU in support of EU product legislation. Each European standard (EN) supports the functioning of the Single Market. European standards replace 34 different national standards in EU, EEA/EFTA and candidate/neighbouring countries, preventing technical fragmentation and ensuring coherence of the system.\", \"How does EU standardisation work?\": \"The European standardisation system is based on a public-private partnership between the Commission and the standardisation community, which is structured in private non-for-profit organisations: the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN), the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation (CENELEC), and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). European standards in support of EU legislation and policies are developed exclusively through one of them. Standardisation activities at these organisations are based on consensus-building among different actors, including industry, SMEs, trade organisations and other private, societal and public stakeholders. The Commission is responsible for the assessment of European harmonised standards developed in support of EU law and for their reference in the Official Journal of the EU. Once a standard is referenced in the Official Journal, it is considered to be part of EU law. The Commission provides financial support to the three European Standardisation Organisations, for their work in support of EU legislation and policies.\", \"Why is a new Standardisation Strategy needed?\": \"Until now, standardisation has often been considered a merely technical matter, and EU leadership in international standardisation has too often been taken for granted. The new Standardisation Strategy puts standards in the focus of EU policy. Standards will play a critical enabling role to face the current challenges of our industries. We will need standards for the data economy, to enable data inter-operability be it for robots, autonomous cars or machinery. Standards are also essential to ensure that new technologies reflect our democratic values, be it in ensuring data protection standards or by addressing the governance of internet protocols. At the same time, standards are also becoming a crucial aspect of strengthening Europe's open strategic autonomy. Increasingly, third countries are taking a more assertive stance to standardisation, and pushing for their technological solutions through technical standardisation committees. The EU wants to lead in such efforts, especially when it comes to strategic areas like batteries or other solutions related to the green and digital twin transitions.\", \"What are the key objectives of the new Standardisation Strategy?\": \"The new Strategy proposes a series of actions aimed at ensuring European leadership in global standards, making standardisation a driver of European competitiveness and resilience, ensuring standards support our investments in the green and digital transitions and embedding democratic values in technology applications. To do so, the Strategy first proposes actions to improve the agility and governance of the European standardisation system and shorten the time needed to develop European standards. This includes better anticipating and prioritising urgent standardisation needs in strategic areas and improving the governance of the European standardisation organisations. In this view, the Commission is proposing to amend the rules relating to the governance of the European Standardisation Organisations, to make sure that key decisions are taken by national standardisation bodies from the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA). This will also ensure greater inclusiveness of the process, given that these national bodies represent all relevant stakeholders in their respective Member States. The Strategy also envisages a series of measures to support the standardisation of the results of European-funded research. Given the increasing lack of available standardisation expertise, especially due to a generational change, the Strategy will also support the development of new skilled experts to support standardisation of new generation technologies. The Strategy also foresees actions to increase the coordination of European and Member States' interests in international standardisation organisations. This will help address the current fragmentation and strengthen the EU's voice in global standardisation, in an inclusive manner. It will also help to harness Europe's potential to be the first mover and to lead international standards setting, leveraging its cooperation with other like-minded international partners.\", \"What will the Commission do to improve the standardisation process in Europe?\": \"The EU needs a fast, responsive, efficient and inclusive standardisation system to meet its objectives for the digital and green transitions of the EU economy, and to strengthen the resilience and the functioning of the Single Market. This involves better addressing standardisation urgencies, or areas where standards are needed to avoid strategic dependencies and to manifest the EU's global leadership in strategic technologies. Improving the governance of the European Standardisation Organisations will help to achieve these objectives. In addition, the Commission is also presenting a new 2022 annual Union work programme for European standardisation, reflecting the standardisation urgencies. It calls upon European Standardisation Organisations (ESOs) to prioritise the delivery of indicated standardisation requests without delay. In addition, a High Level Forum will bring together representatives of Member States, European Standardisation Organisations and National Standardisation Bodies, industry, SMEs, civil society and academia to help set priorities, advise on future standardisation needs, coordinate European interests and ensure that European standardisation activities respond to the ambitions of the twin transitions and resilience of the EU. Furthermore, the Commission will increase internal coordination of standardisation activities through the creation of an EU excellence hub on standards, steered by a Chief Standardisation Officer.\", \"Why is the Commission addressing the governance of European standardisation organisations?\": \"The Standardisation Regulation gives a central role to three European Standardisation Organisations, namely CEN, CENELEC and ETSI. These are the only entities allowed to develop European standards in support of EU legislation. The Commission wants to ensure a balanced stakeholder representation within the ESOs to avoid that large corporations (which are in many cases not headquartered in the EU) dominate the decision-making processes. In particular, it wants to ensure that key decisions on standards that are developed at the request of the Commission are taken by the national standardisation bodies of the EU and EEA Member States, which represent the full stakeholder community. This will also ensure that these organisations can respond to European standardisation requests by developing standards that comply with rules imposed in the interest of EU citizens. To this end, the Commission is today presenting an amendment to Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 to improve the governance in the European standardisation system. The Commission calls on the European Standardisation Organisations to align their internal governance processes accordingly to allow them to continue to respond to the Commission's requests for the development of new harmonised standards. In addition, the Commission will continue to pay close attention to the inclusiveness of the system \\u2013 the role of SMEs, civil society \\u2013 by launching a review process of national measures.\", \"How does the Commission plan to better coordinate EU and Member States' interests globally?\": \"The EU remains committed to an open and transparent standardisation system in line with its obligations under the WTO/TBT Agreement. Traditionally, the EU has been a strong leader in international standardisation activities but needs to take account of a changed geopolitical situation, as other countries start to approach international standardisation more strategically and gain influence in international standardisation committees. To strengthen EU's position in international standardisation fora, the new Strategy proposes to better coordinate standardisation activities among the EU and national standardisation bodies. To this end, the High-Level Forum will facilitate the identification of the standardisation activities of strategic importance for the EU and will facilitate political concertation between the Commission and Member States on such priorities. This high-level political coordination will serve as a basis for collaborations on important international standardisation activities between the EU and like-minded partners.\", \"What is the Commission doing to facilitate standardisation of EU funded research?\": \"The Commission is proposing to better tap into the potential of EU funded research to valorise the innovation value of such projects and their potential for standardisation. Identifying future standardisation opportunities early on will help to build important bridges between the research, innovator and standardiser communities and anticipate early standardisation needs. To do this, the Commission will launch a \\u2018standardisation booster', a platform to help beneficiaries, whose Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe research results are likely to lead to the revision or creation of a standard, to test the relevance of their results for standardisation. A Code of Practice on standardisation for researchers will furthermore allow to strengthen the link between research/innovation and standardisation within the European Research Area (ERA), expected in mid-2022.\", \"What is the Commission doing to enhance standardisation skills and expertise?\": \"Standards rely on the best experts, but Europe is currently facing a generational shift that risks a loss of crucial standardisation expertise. Moreover, there is no formal education or vocational training on standardisation. At the same time, the standardisation landscape is becoming more complex: new technology challenges and horizontal considerations \\u2013 like data protection or cybersecurity \\u2013 will require new skills in the development of standards. To address this, it is crucial to engage with the research and innovation community early on in standards development, and provide opportunities to build expertise and skills in standardisation. Moreover, the Commission will promote more academic awareness on standards through the future organisation of EU University Days. Training of researchers will also be encouraged through the existing tools under Horizon Europe and the EURATOM Research and Training Programme.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_712\": {\"How ambitious are the technical screening criteria, and do the included activities really lead to environmental benefits, e.g. as compared to energy production from coal?\": \"The Taxonomy Complementary Climate Delegated Act includes strict requirements for the activities to qualify. In the case of fossil gas-related activities, for example, the facility should switch fully to renewable or low-carbon gases by 31 December 2035. This can help accelerate the transition from high-emitting energy sources, such as coal, to renewable or low-carbon gases. Nuclear power is low-carbon. Expert advice sought by the Commission as part of its preparatory work (the reports of the Technical Expert Group until 2020, and the report of the Joint Research Committee in 2021) confirms this. Following scientific advice, the Commission has concluded that nuclear energy, subject to strict safety and environmental conditions (including on waste disposal) that ensure the respect of the do no significant harm principle, can play a role in the transition towards climate neutrality in line with the European Green Deal.\", \"What is the rationale for defining nuclear activities as being in line with the EU's climate and environmental objectives?\": \"The Technical Expert Group on Sustainable Finance, advising the Commission on Taxonomy, acknowledged that nuclear represents a low-carbon energy source. This is in line with the positions of international organisations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the UN Economic Commission for Europe, which consider CO2 emissions from nuclear power plants over their life-cycle comparable to those from renewable energy sources (as low or even lower). However, expert opinion has been less conclusive on the other environmental impacts of nuclear power and its compatibility with the \\u201cdo no significant harm (DNSH)\\u201d criterion. For this reason, the Commission set up a specific process on nuclear energy, involving a technical assessment by the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the European Commission's science and knowledge service. Their report was published and reviewed by Member States' experts on radiation protection and waste management appointed by the Scientific and Technical Committee under Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty, as well as by experts from the Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks (SCHEER). Overall, the report and reviews conclude that compliance with the safety standards and waste management requirements under the regulatory framework in EU Member States ensures a high level of protection for the environment and for people. For nuclear energy activities to be enlisted under the taxonomy, the screening criteria set requirements beyond the existing regulatory framework; for instance sunset dates for accelerating transition to advanced technologies, and definite dates for operational disposal facilities to be in place.\", \"What about nuclear waste?\": \"The Taxonomy Regulation requires that the long-term disposal of waste does not cause significant or long-term harm to the environment. Nuclear energy generates a relatively low amount of waste in comparison to the large amount of generated heat and/or electricity. It produces mainly low-level radioactive waste, for which there are disposal facilities that have operated for decades, while high-level radioactive waste accounts for 1% of total nuclear waste. The EU regulatory framework establishes the legal requirement for national policies to keep the generation of radioactive waste to a minimum. In addition, the technical screening criteria for nuclear energy go beyond requiring mere compliance with legislation regarding radioactive waste management and disposal.  Notably, disposal facilities for low-level waste must be operational already, and Member States should have in place a detailed plan to have in operation, by 2050, a disposal facility for high-level radioactive waste. Some Member States have more advanced projects regarding the long-term disposal of nuclear waste. The inclusion of nuclear energy in the EU Taxonomy can accelerate the development of solutions for final waste disposal elsewhere in the EU. In addition, the technical screening criteria for nuclear energy prohibit the export of radioactive waste for disposal in third countries.\", \"What is the rationale for defining certain gas-related activities as \\u201dsubstantially contributing to\\u201d the EU climate and environmental objectives?\": \"During the public consultation conducted in November 2020 for the preparation of the Climate Delegated Act, the energy sector attracted the largest number of responses. Stakeholders notably commented on bioenergy, hydropower, geothermal plants, hydrogen and natural gas. Many stakeholders suggested that natural gas should be recognised for its role as a transition fuel in decarbonisation and that criteria for transitional activities should take into account different starting points across Member States and be attainable with existing technologies. The first EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act did not include any transitional activities in the energy sector. However, the European Commission committed to adopting a complementary Delegated Act capturing activities relevant for the climate objectives, but not yet reflected in the first Climate Delegated Act. The European Union has translated the goal of the Paris Agreement into a long-term European growth strategy. Under the European Green Deal, the EU is working on implementing a comprehensive set of legislative proposals (most recently, the Fit for 55 Package). The European Commission tabled its proposals based on robust evidence: the Fit for 55 Package rests on a common analytical base with energy system modelling at its core. According to the scenarios in this modelling, natural gas will continue to play an important role in terms of consumption and generation until 2030, after which we expect a decline to 2050. Throughout the transition of our energy system, the function of natural gas-fired electricity generation will change and will increasingly be a facilitator for the spread of renewable electricity and stable supply. The EU Taxonomy complements these policies and plays a role in transitioning the financial sector to a more sustainable model. The Complementary Delegated Act has been prepared using the same coherent analytical base as the one of the Climate Target Plan and the Fit for 55 Package. The Commission's proposal is therefore consistent with the Commission's modelling underpinning its most ambitious legislative package for our climate. The Complementary Delegated Act recognises the specific role of natural gas-related activities in the transition. The carefully crafted set of technical screening criteria ensure that all relevant requirements of the Taxonomy Regulation are complied with. By identifying the role of natural gas in the transition, the Delegated Act also recognises the different situations in our Member States, while contributing to a sustainable transition.\", \"Unlike nuclear power, natural gas undoubtedly releases CO2 when it is converted into electricity or heat. How can this form of energy lead to environmental benefits?\": \"The Taxonomy Regulation sets out that substantial contribution to climate change mitigation can be achieved through, among other things, the avoidance or reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Article 10(2) complements this by phasing out greenhouse gas emissions, in particular emissions from solid fossil fuels \\u2013 a requirement that has been taken into account in the technical screening criteria in the Complementary Delegated Act, along with the other requirements applicable to transitional activities. In the Commission's modelling for Paris-aligned pathways, natural gas is projected to represent 22% of gross inland energy consumption in 2030, and 9% in 2050. Any natural gas in 2050 will have to be abated. The technical screening criteria ensure that any new gas-based power/heat plant (or refurbished combined heat and power plant or heat/cool plant) is either below the technology-neutral 100g CO2/kWh life-cycle emission threshold (i.e. using Carbon Capture and Storage technologies) or meets a number of stringent conditions and obtains a construction permit by 2030. Importantly, the use of gas should act as a replacement of plants running on more polluting solid and liquid fossil fuels (e.g. coal). As regards the co-generation of heat and power and heating/cooling activities, for every new natural gas-fired plant to be built, a coal-fired plant with the same capacity has to be removed for the technical screening criteria to be complied with. Regarding the power generation, the capacity of the gas-fired plant cannot exceed the capacity of the coal-fired plant by more than 15%. Facilities have to integrate a rapid conversion towards renewables with a clear commitment for a full switch to renewables by 2035.\", \"How is the Complementary Climate Delegated Act going to address the energy price discussions?\": \"The Taxonomy is not an instrument of EU energy policy. It is a tool to increase transparency in financial markets for private sector sustainable investments. It does not mandate investments and does not prevent any economic sector from receiving investments. Member States remain fully responsible and competent for deciding their own energy mix and for striking the appropriate balance \\u2013 in terms of energy security, energy price stability and their commitment to decarbonisation and climate neutrality. The Taxonomy is an important element in the sustainable finance toolkit to help fund the Green Deal. The spike in energy prices that the EU is facing is a major concern for the European Commission. Supporting a clean energy transition would allow us not just to avert the disastrous impacts of climate change but also to reduce the EU's vulnerability to fossil fuel price volatility. In the medium term, our policy response should focus on making the EU more efficient in the use of energy, less dependent on fossil fuels and more resilient to energy price spikes, while providing affordable and clean energy to end-users. The Complementary Delegated Act is part of these efforts and aims to drive the EU towards the required green transition to a decarbonised economy.\", \"Aren't you exacerbating EU dependence on gas from third countries?\": \"The Taxonomy does not favour any one source of energy from a specific region. Investment decisions remain commercial decisions based on many economic and financial factors. The European Green Deal and its ambitious climate and energy objectives are our best guarantee to reduce our energy dependency (by increasing investment in renewable energy sources). By creating a strong home market, we are seeing the EU clean tech industry thrive as part of the ongoing economic recovery, supported by funding for environmental goals under the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility. This Complementary Climate Delegated Act recognises the role that certain energy activities can play in supporting decarbonisation, for a limited period of time, until better alternatives based on renewable or low-carbon technologies are sufficiently developed. Content of the Delegated Act\", \"What activities and accompanying criteria does the Complementary Climate Delegated Act introduce?\": \"Today's Complementary Climate Delegated Act: introduces additional economic activities from the energy sector into the EU Taxonomy. The Delegated Act includes in particular certain nuclear energy activities that can play a role, under strict conditions regarding nuclear and environmental safety (also related to waste disposal), in the EU's transition towards climate neutrality. It also covers some gas energy activities as transitional activities, subject to specific conditions which recognise the role gas can play to help some regions transition from the most polluting solid fossil fuel energy sources, such as coal, to renewable energy. introduces specific disclosure requirements for businesses related to their activities in the gas and nuclear energy sectors. Those requirements should further enhance the information provided to investors and improve transparency. More specifically, this Complementary Climate Delegated Act covers the following activities: Nuclear-related activities: Advanced technologies with closed fuel cycle (\\u201cGeneration IV\\u201d) to incentivise research and innovation into future technologies in terms of safety standards and minimising waste (with no sunset clause);New nuclear power plant projects for energy generation, which will be using best-available existing technologies (\\u201cGeneration III+\\u201d), will be recognised until 2045 (date of approval of construction permit);Modifications and upgrades of existing nuclear installations for the purposes of lifetime extension, will be recognised until 2040 (date of approval by competent authority) Gas-related activities: Electricity generation from fossil gaseous fuelsHigh-efficiency co-generation of heat/cool and power from fossil gaseous fuelsProduction of heat/cool from fossil gaseous fuels in an efficient district heating and cooling system Each gas-related activity needs to meet either of the following emission thresholds: lifecycle emissions are below 100gCO2e/kWh, oruntil 2030 (date of approval of construction permit), and where renewables are not available at sufficient scale, direct emissions are below 270gCO2e/kWh or, for the activity of electricity generation, their annual direct GHG emissions must not exceed an average of 550kgCO2e/kW of the facility's capacity over 20 years. In this case, the activity must meet a set of cumulative conditions: e.g. it replaces a facility using solid or liquid fossil fuels, the activity ensures a full switch to renewable or low-carbon gases by 2035, and a regular independent verification of compliance with the criteria is carried out.\", \"What are the amendments introduced to the Delegated Act on disclosures under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation?\": \"In order to provide a high degree of market transparency regarding investments in natural gas and nuclear energy activities covered by this Delegated Act, financial and non-financial companies should present specific disclosure requirements that would show to what degree gas and nuclear energy activities, complying with the technical screening criteria, is in the numerator and denominator of the key performance indicators of those undertakings. This should help investors to distinguish among activities they invest in. With the help of this specific disclosure requirement, investors that are not willing to invest in nuclear and gas activities under the conditions in this Delegated Act would be able to identify and invest in activities and financial products that have no exposures to economic activities in the nuclear and gas sectors. In addition, in order to provide a high degree of transparency to investors in financial products concerning exposures to fossil gas and nuclear energy activities, the Commission will explore amending further the disclosure framework pertaining to those financial products as appropriate, to provide for full transparency over the whole life of those financial products. To ensure that such information is clearly identified by end-investors, the Commission will consider amending the requirements on the financial and insurance advice given by distributors.\", \"How did you amend the Complementary Climate Delegated Act following the consultation?\": \"As a result of the feedback, adjustments to the technical screening criteria and disclosure and verification requirements were introduced to reinforce notably their clarity and usability. Some criteria were made more flexible, to reflect commercial availability and technological readiness. Specific adjustments were made to make certain criteria more workable across Member States. Transparency and verification requirements were reinforced to improve information and credibility towards investors. Process\", \"Why did the Commission not launch a public consultation? Why was the European Parliament not formally consulted? How will stakeholders benefit?\": \"The Commission signalled its intention in April 2021 to come forward with a Complementary Climate Delegated Act to help accelerate the transition to a cleaner energy future. The Commission prepares and adopts delegated acts after consulting expert groups, composed of representatives from each EU country. The Platform on Sustainable Finance (PSF) and the Member States Expert Group on Sustainable Finance (MSEG) must be consulted on all Delegated Acts under the Taxonomy Regulation, given their expert role foreseen by the Taxonomy Regulation. As part of the process, the European Parliament receives the same information as Member States, and is invited to submit its views. The relevant issues concerning natural gas and nuclear energy in relation to the Taxonomy have been in the public domain since 2020, marked by extensive exchanges, expert analysis and stakeholder feedback. Various stakeholders have expressed their positions on nuclear and gas on multiple occasions over the last months and years. The Commission has built on this to present a targeted compromise subject to consultation. There have been significant public deliberations around the Taxonomy Regulation, the work of the Technical Expert Group, and the finalisation of the first Climate Delegated Act. The issues on gas and nuclear have also been discussed several times with Member States and the European Parliament during the course of these discussions. Stakeholders have submitted extensive feedback to the Commission on these activities, based on the options discussed for the first draft of the Climate Delegated Act for gas-related activities, and on the JRC report and expert committee reviews for nuclear-related activities. A general public consultation for the proposal was not envisaged, given the involvement of experts through a specific review process for an in-depth assessment of the DNSH aspects set out for nuclear energy and the consultation of the PSF and MSEG. First, a technical assessment of nuclear energy under the Taxonomy Regulation (and the DNSH criterion) was prepared by the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the European Commission's science and knowledge service. That report was published and reviewed by Member States' experts on radiation protection and waste management appointed by the Scientific and Technical Committee under Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty, as well as by experts from the Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks (SCHEER). As a result, in line with the requirements of the Taxonomy Regulation (including Articles 10(3), 11(3), 20(2), 23(4) and 24(2)), the activities covered in the Complementary Delegated Act have undergone extensive analysis and scrutiny in the preparatory phase and benefitted from input from a wide range of experts. In addition to the consultation with the Platform on Sustainable Finance and Member States experts before adoption, this Delegated Act will also be subject to a scrutiny period by the co-legislators (see specific question). Similar to the first Climate Delegated Act, the European Parliament and Council will have four months to formulate any objections, and two additional months if they deem necessary. Once the scrutiny period is over and assuming neither of the co-legislators objects, the Complementary Delegated Act will enter into force.\", \"Why the Commission did not include gas and nuclear into a new category of activities distinct from the current Taxonomy?\": \"The Commission appreciates the assessment made by some, for example the Platform on Sustainable Finance, that some of the activities and criteria would be more appropriate in a possible future Taxonomy category of the framework, encompassing \\u201cintermediate\\u201d or \\u201camber\\u201d environmental performance levels, distinct from the current Taxonomy, on which the Platform is preparing proposals. The Platform is mandated to help design a transition Taxonomy framework that works across markets \\u2013 and it remains fully valid. The Commission welcomes the conceptual work of the Platform in this respect and looks forward to seeing the final report in the near future. Without pre-empting the final outcome of the work by the Platform, the Commission, after lengthy consideration, has taken the position that the urgency of the transition-imperative can be to the extent possible addressed, in part, through the Taxonomy Regulation as it stands today. It is crucial to make full use of existing provisions of the Taxonomy Regulation, given the urgency of the climate crisis. This possibility was outlined in the Commission Communications of April and July 2021 on upcoming steps regarding sustainable finance. Developments since then, including in energy markets and Member States' emissions trajectories, have only reinforced the need to act now, where we can.\", \"What is the timeframe for the implementation of this Delegated Act? Will there be a phased-in entry into force of this Delegated Act?\": \"After the scrutiny period of the European Parliament and the Council, this Delegated Act is expected to apply as of 1 January 2023. The application date has been set out to provide stakeholders with sufficient time to assess whether their economic activities comply with the technical screening criteria under this Delegated Act and to report on the basis of that assessment.\", \"Once adopted, will this Delegated Act be reviewed?\": \"The Taxonomy Regulation provides for future reviews of the technical screening criteria set out in this Complementary Climate Delegated Act every three years following their application. This will concern in particular the appropriateness of the time limits provided by the Delegated Act for the recognition of contributions of certain gas and nuclear energy activities to climate change mitigation.\", \"How long will the scrutiny period by the co-legislators last?\": \"Similar to the first Climate Delegated Act, the European Parliament and the Council (who have delegated the power to the Commission to adopt this Delegated Act) will have four months to scrutinise the document, and, should they find it necessary, to object to it. In line with the Taxonomy Regulation, both institutions may request an additional two months of scrutiny time. The Council will have the right to object to it by reinforced qualified majority (which means that at least 72% of MS (i.e. at least 20 MS) representing at least 65% of the EU population are needed to object to the DA), and the European Parliament by a majority of its members (i.e. at least 353 MEPs) in Plenary. Once the scrutiny period is over and assuming neither of the co-legislators objects, the Complementary Climate Delegated Act will enter into force and apply.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_566\": {\"What are the main changes introduced in the revised Guidelines on State aid for climate, environmental protection and energy (\\u2018CEEAG')?\": \"The new Guidelines provide the framework for public authorities to support the European Green Deal objectives efficiently and with minimum distortions of competition. In particular, the new Guidelines: Broaden the categories of investments and technologies that Member States can support to cover new areas (e.g. clean mobility infrastructure, resource efficiency, biodiversity) and all technologies that can deliver the Green Deal (e.g. renewable hydrogen, electricity storage and demand response, decarbonising production processes). The revised rules generally allow for aid amounts covering up to 100% of the funding gap where aid awards are based on competitive bidding, and to introduce new aid instruments such as Contracts for Difference.Increase flexibility and streamline the existing rules, by introducing a simplified assessment of cross-cutting measures under a single section of the Guidelines (for example the section on aid for the reduction and removal of greenhouse gas emissions, including through support for renewable energy and energy efficiency) and eliminating the requirement for individual notifications of large green projects within aid schemes previously approved by the Commission.Introduce safeguards, such as a public consultation requirement above certain thresholds, to ensure that the aid is effectively directed where it is necessary to improve climate and environmental protection, is limited to what is needed to achieve the environmental goals and does not unduly distort competition or the integrity of the Single Market.Ensure coherence with the relevant EU legislation and policies in the environmental and energy fields, among others by phasing out subsidies for fossil fuels.\", \"How will the CEEAG interact with the General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER)?\": \"While the CEEAG include some specific rules for small projects, they are generally designed to cover also larger aid measures. They operate alongside the General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER), which provides scope for certain smaller schemes to be implemented without prior approval by the Commission. The GBER is currently undergoing a targeted revision with the aim to further facilitate green investments by widening its scope to cover aid for investments in new technologies, such as hydrogen and carbon capture and storage or usage, and for areas that are key to achieve the objectives of the Green Deal, like resource efficiency and biodiversity. Moreover, the rules are more flexible with regard to the definition of eligible costs and aid intensities.\", \"How will the CEEAG contribute to the Green Deal / Fit for 55 package?\": \"The CEEAG will help Member States meet the European Green Deal objectives, at the least possible cost for taxpayers and without unduly distorting competition. To this end, the Guidelines are aligned with relevant EU legislation and policies in the environmental and energy fields. In particular: The CEEAG adopt a technology neutral approach to all the technologies that can contribute to the reduction or removal of greenhouse gases, including renewable energy and energy efficiency. However, technology specific tenders remain possible, for example where Union law establishes specific sectoral or technology based targets, e.g. for renewable energy under the Renewable Energy Directive.To facilitate the implementation of the Renovation Wave, the CEEAG include for the first time a dedicated section on the energy and environmental performance of buildings. This will enable Member States to combine aid for the improvement of the energy efficiency of buildings with aid for any other investment that improve the energy or environmental performance of buildings.The CEEAG provide clear rules for support to clean mobility, in line with the Clean Mobility Package. In particular, the Guidelines feature a dedicated section covering aid for the acquisition of clean vehicles and retrofitting of vehicles, as well as for the deployment of recharging and refuelling infrastructure.The CEEAG provide for a broad coverage of and clearer rules for aid to increase the level of resource efficiency of companies, and allow for the development of a more circular economy, in line with the Circular Economy Action Plan.In line with the objectives of the Biodiversity Strategy, the CEEAG provide clear rules for Member States to support the protection and restoration of biodiversity, the rehabilitation of natural ecosystems and the implementation of nature-based solutions, for which so far no specific State aid guidance existed.\", \"What is the link between the CEEAG and Taxonomy?\": \"The CEEAG and the EU Taxonomy are both important pillars of the European Green Deal, fulfilling different but complementary roles: The CEEAG are the EU rulebook for public support in the energy and environmental sectors, setting out which projects can be supported with public funds and how this support can be provided, while minimising impacts on the market and providing value to European citizens.The EU Taxonomy is a tool developed to enable private investors to re-orient investments towards more sustainable technologies and businesses. It will help make the EU a global leader in setting standards for sustainable finance. The Taxonomy can be a very useful tool in the context of EU State aid assessments. Where measures meet the taxonomy requirements, the State aid assessment can be simplified. In particular, in balancing the positive and negative effects of the aid, the Commission will pay particular attention to compliance with the \\u2018do no significant harm' principle. However, there are other conditions in competition rules that would still need to be applied to ensure for example that the aid is necessary and proportionate (by way of example, the taxonomy identifies renewable energy as sustainable, and the competition rules then generally require renewable energy to be supported through competitive bidding processes). Support may in some cases also be granted to projects that do not meet the standards laid down in the Taxonomy so long as their positive effects are justified and a lock-in of non-sustainable activities is avoided.\", \"How can the CEEAG contribute to tackling high energy prices?\": \"The current high energy prices in Europe are mostly the result of global supply and demand patterns in the natural gas market, driven in part by the global economic recovery. On 13 October, the Commission adopted a Communication on \\u201ctackling rising energy prices while delivering the green transition\\u201d that describes the main tools for Member States to tackle this challenge, and how the Commission can support them in this respect. Following up to the Communication of 13 October, and as requested by Member States, in December 2021, the Commission proposed to improve the resilience of the gas system and strengthen the existing security of supply provisions. The best way to reduce energy costs in the medium and long term is to reduce the EU's dependence on fossil fuel imports, and thus to accelerate the energy transition towards an energy efficient electricity system, based on renewable energy. The CEEAG support this target. For example, the CEEAG cover support measures to help companies quickly adapt and fully participate in the energy transition. This includes for example support for decarbonisation measures or increased energy efficiency, reducing the impact of increased electricity or gas prices for undertakings. Competition law allows a range of measures that Member States can take without unduly distorting competition in the market. These include direct support measures to the most vulnerable and energy-poor, such as payments or energy allowances. Moreover, measures of a general nature, equally helping all energy consumers, do not constitute State aid. Such non-selective measures can take the form of general reductions in taxes or levies, a reduced rate to the supply of natural gas, electricity or district heating.\", \"How do the CEEAG foster the development of renewable energy communities and other smaller actors?\": \"Renewable energy communities (REC) and other small actors play an important role in the achievement of the European Green Deal objectives, as also recognised in the recast Renewable Energy Directive (RED II). This is why the CEEAG provides additional flexibility for these actors, allowing Member States to exempt renewable energy community projects and SME-owned projects below 6 Megawatts (MW) of installed capacity from the competitive bidding requirement. Renewable energy communities and small and micro enterprises may also develop wind projects up to 18 MW without competitive bidding. More generally, where competitive bidding does apply, the CEEAG enable Member States to design tenders in a way which enhances the participation of energy communities, for example by lowering pre-qualification requirements. SMEs and small mid-caps can also benefit from aid when they provide energy performance improvement measures under energy performance contracts, either for buildings or industrial activities. Furthermore, aid intensities can be increased by 20 percentage points for small undertakings or by 10 percentage points for medium-sized undertakings for a number of aid categories such as aid for energy performance improvements in buildings, aid for the acquisition of zero-emission vehicles and the deployment of recharging and refuelling infrastructure, aid for resources efficiency, aid for the prevention or the reduction of pollution other than from greenhouse gases, and for studies or consultancy services on matters relating to climate, environmental protection and energy.\", \"Why is nuclear energy not covered by the Guidelines?\": \"The CEEAG follow the same line as the previous guidelines (the 2014  Energy and Environmental Aid Guidelines, EEAG) and therefore do not apply to nuclear energy. This is because support for nuclear energy generally concerns a limited number of very large projects, is particularly sensitive from a security perspective, legally needs to take account particularly of the EURATOM treaty, and thus requires a case-by-case assessment. State aid for nuclear energy can, however, be approved directly under the Treaty and the EURATOM Treaty. While support for nuclear energy is per se not covered by the CEEAG, support for the production of other energy sources based on nuclear, e.g. low-carbon hydrogen produced using nuclear energy, is possible under the Guidelines so long as these projects deliver emissions reductions and do not lead to increased demand for electricity generated from fossil fuels.\", \"Do the CEEAG cover aid for the production of products contributing to the green transition (e.g. zero-emission vehicles, electrolysers, etc.)?\": \"The CEEAG do not cover aid for the manufacturing of environmentally friendly products, machines or means of transport. As already recognised under the previous guidelines (2014 EEAG), environmental aid is generally less distortive and more effective if it is granted to the consumer or user of environmentally friendly products instead of the producer or manufacturer of the environmentally friendly product. Aiding the producer or manufacturer of the environmentally friendly product does not bring about an environmental benefit in itself; such benefit materialises only if and when such products substitute more polluting alternatives. However, by creating the right enabling conditions for support, the CEEAG are likely to indirectly boost demand for greener products. For example, support for the acquisition of electric vehicles and/or the roll-out of recharging infrastructure for electric vehicles are likely to increase the demand for such vehicles in the market. In addition, Member States may grant environmental aid to companies to enhance the level of environmental protection of their manufacturing activities. Producers and manufacturers can  also receive aid for developing novel environmentally friendly products under the research, development and innovation (R&D&I) State aid rules (GBER or R&D&I Framework).\", \"Can fossil fuels be supported under the CEEAG?\": \"The CEEAG ensure coherence with the Union climate targets by contributing to phasing out the possibility of subsidies for fossil fuels. For the most polluting fossil fuels, the guidelines foresee that a positive assessment by the Commission under State aid rules is unlikely in light of their negative environmental effects. For natural gas, the Commission acknowledges its role in a transitional period. State aid for projects involving natural gas is subject to important safeguards to ensure compatibility with the EU's 2030 and 2050 climate targets. In that context, it is important that support for natural gas does not lead to lock-in effects. For example, large capital investments in a certain polluting technology are unlikely to incentivise the operator to change to a less polluting technology in the short term. Therefore, measures involving new investments in natural gas are unlikely to be assessed positively under State aid rules, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that the investments are compatible with the Union's 2030 and 2050 climate targets. This requirement is modulated according to types of investment. For example, for natural gas infrastructure, investments will be required to be \\u201cfit for hydrogen\\u201d and renewable gases. For energy generation additional commitments may be required (see next question).\", \"How will the Commission assess whether fossil fuel investments are compatible with the 2030 and 2050 climate targets?\": \"The Commission may require commitments to ensure the \\u2018lock in' of fossil fuels is avoided and fossil fuel installations are compatible with the 2030 and 2050 targets. This may include for example commitments related to the future deployment of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), replacing natural gas with green gas, or a closure timeline for the installation.\", \"The CEEAG include safeguards, such as the requirement for public consultation and quantification of the CO2 abatement cost. Why are they necessary?\": \"By ensuring transparency and inclusiveness, these safeguards contribute to ensuring value for money. Such safeguards are also important to ensure that the increased flexibility and amount of aid allowed under the CEEAG is effectively directed where it is needed to improve environmental protection, is limited to what is needed to achieve the environmental goals and does not unduly distort competition or the integrity of the internal market. Moreover, some of the safeguards \\u2013 for example the public consultation requirement - are applicable only for schemes or projects that exceed a certain budget, to avoid excessive burdens for smaller aid applicants or straightforward measures. The requirement to quantify the environmental benefit of the measure is important to increase awareness of the relative value for money of different approaches to decarbonisation. Member States will have time to adapt to these new requirements, which will only apply as from July 2023.\", \"How do the CEEAG facilitate the needed electrification of industries?\": \"The Commission is well aware of the challenges facing the industries in meeting the objectives of the Green Deal. That is why the Guidelines increase the possibilities to grant aid for industrial decarbonisation, including through electrification of production processes. The CEEAG foresee additional flexibility for a variety of aid instruments, they enable aid for the full additional costs of more environmentally friendly activities, and they cover a wider range of technologies to achieve the Green Deal objectives. Where electrification is supported, it is however important to ensure that the emissions from electricity used to meet the additional electricity demand are properly taken into account. In that context, the new rules for reduction of electricity levies (see question further below) seek a balance between supporting the efforts of energy-intensive users to electrify their industrial processes, while making sure that the right incentives to enhance energy efficiency are also in place.\", \"Will technology neutral competitive bidding favour established technologies against innovative ones?\": \"Competitive bidding procedures have helped to lower the price of renewable energy, favouring the uptake  of more efficient technologies like wind and solar energy. Moreover, competitive bidding can reduce the risk of overcompensation, thereby also ensuring the best value for money for tax payers. For these reasons, competitive bidding will be the default mechanism under most sections of the CEEAG to award aid. Where possible, open tenders across comparable areas and technologies are encouraged. Nevertheless, the Guidelines also provide an open list of situations justifying technology specific tenders. These include grid issues, the demonstrated long-term potential of a technology, cost efficiency, and other environmental objectives. Furthermore, in cases, where Union law establishes specific sectoral or technology based targets (e.g. for energy efficiency under the Energy Efficiency Directive or for renewables under the Renewable Energy Directive) or where new technologies need to be demonstrated, the CEEAG offer Member States flexibility to design more targeted measures.\", \"What is the \\u2018funding gap'?\": \"The funding gap corresponds to the difference between the costs and revenues of an activity that contributes to the achievement of higher climate, energy or environmental standards compared to the costs and revenues of a similar, less environmentally friendly activity that would be carried out in the absence of aid. Therefore, the funding gap identifies the minimum aid necessary to incentivise the aided activity. Specific sections/areas of the Guidelines Renewable energy sources\", \"How do the CEEAG support the deployment of renewables?\": \"Renewable energy remains as important as ever to reach the EU's ambitious climate targets. To enable Member States to support all technologies and approaches that can contribute to the Green Deal, and to ensure the Guidelines are as future proof as possible, the new Guidelines include provisions explicitly covering support for renewable energy. Member States can deploy specific renewable schemes to contribute to the EU's renewable energy targets and support specific renewable technologies where this achieves lower costs or other efficiency or environmental benefits. Energy and environmental performance of buildings\", \"How do the CEEAG facilitate support energy efficiency of buildings?\": \"The CEEAG include a dedicated section on the energy and environmental performance of buildings, which introduces a simplified assessment, in particular as regards the determination of the eligible costs. Furthermore, the CEEAG enable Member States to combine aid for the improvement of the energy efficiency of buildings with aid for any other investments that improve their energy or environmental performance, provided that the aid induces a minimum level of energy savings. Moreover, aid measures that induce ambitious energy savings are eligible for a green bonus. Finally, the section contains specific rules on liquidity aid to Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) for the facilitation of energy performance contracting. Clean mobility\", \"What do the CEEAG say on clean mobility?\": \"State aid for the acquisition of new transport vehicles and for the retrofitting of vehicles could already be approved under the previous Guidelines (2014 EEAG). The CEEAG introduces four new elements: stricter requirements for vehicles to be considered as \\u2018clean'. Aid will no longer be available for marginal improvements in the level of emissions of CO2 or other pollutants.detailed guidance to Member States to help them design their support measures and thereby facilitate the uptake of zero and low-emission vehicles and the roll-out of the necessary infrastructure for their operation. The new rules also clarify that aid can be granted for the greening of all transport modes, including aviation, and provide dedicated provisions catering for the specific characteristics of the different transport modes.increased flexibility for Member States to determine the eligible costs and the amount of support that is necessary.broader scope, with a new section on aid for the deployment of recharging and refuelling infrastructure for all transport modes. This will help increasing the level of legal certainty for Member States and stakeholders and facilitate Member States' support measures in this important area. Resource efficiency\", \"What is the chapter about resource efficiency about? Does it support green products?\": \"The chapter on aid for resource efficiency has been extensively revised to address the challenges of ensuring the transition towards a circular economy. State aid for waste management, i.e. aid for the collection, sorting and processing of waste, remains possible. Alongside, the CEEAG also include specific provisions on aid for the reduction, prevention, preparing for re-use, recovery and recycling of waste and other products, as well as aid for other investments improving the resource efficiency of production processes by reducing the amount of resources consumed or by replacing primary raw materials with secondary raw materials. This section does not cover aid for the production of green products (see above). Instead, the aim of aid for resource efficiency is to incentivise economic operators to reduce the amount of waste they produce, to use fewer resources, to re-use and to better recycle materials, to increase the usage of recycled and bio-based materials and, generally, to switch to more resource-efficient and eco-friendly production processes. Security of electricity supply\", \"What has changed compared to the 2014 EEAG?\": \"The CEEAG introduce a number of clarifications to better align the security of supply rules with the 2019 Electricity Regulation and to explain how the rules apply to variety of different possible measures for security of supply, including measures related to regional security of supply problems caused by network insufficiency. The rules also further limit the potential for fossil fuels to benefit from support under security of supply measures, and enable Member States to introduce environmental criteria in their security of supply measures to ensure support is targeted at sustainable activities. Energy intensive users\", \"Why does the Commission allow support to energy-intensive industries in the form of reduction on electricity levies?\": \"The Commission only allows reductions in certain electricity levies for industries that have been identified as being electro-intensive and at the same time open to international trade. Due to these two factors, the cost of electricity may play a role in possible relocation decisions. Should such companies decide to produce outside the EU, they would typically move to countries with lower environmental standards. In addition, the switch to electricity in industrial processes is a promising avenue for the decarbonisation of some of these sectors. Lowering decarbonisation levies for particularly exposed sectors may therefore incentivises the electrification of their industrial processes. Lastly, the new rules also require that levy reductions are conditional upon commitments by the beneficiaries to reduce their carbon footprint, either through energy-efficiency measures, or consumption of carbon-free electricity or investments in state-of-the-art technologies which reduce GHG emissions. The new Guidelines codify the existing case practice under which reductions may be granted not only for levies financing renewable policies but for all levies financing decarbonisation and social policies. On the other hand, it is not allowed to grant on this basis reductions from the costs of providing electricity, such as network charges. These components finance costs of generating and distributing electricity in a stable and secure way. Electricity prices must reflect these costs to provide efficient signals to customers, which would be undermined by selective reductions from these price components. The CEEAG allow to extend eligibility to additional sectors and subsectors complying with the thresholds for electro and trade intensity, while making sure that this is consistently based on verified data representative at EU level. This possibility contributes to a level playing field within sectors and subsectors with similar characteristics. Coal, peat and oil shale closure\", \"What is the rationale for introducing rules for aid for coal, peat and oil shale closure?\": \"The shift away from power generation based on coal, peat and oil shale is one of the most important drivers of decarbonisation in the power sector in the EU, in line with the European Green Deal. The new Guidelines introduce compatibility rules for measures that Member States may take to support the early closure of profitable coal, peat and oil shale activities. The Guidelines also allow aid to cover exceptional costs resulting from the closure of uncompetitive coal, peat and oil shale activities. Such aid can, for example, be used to fund compensatory pensions or re-adaptation and training of workers or costs related to the rehabilitation of former power plants and mines. These rules aim to provide a framework for how the Commission will assess such measures, and to incentivise Member States to accelerate or facilitate the closure process in order to ensure both legal certainty as well as a safe, just and fair transition. There were no compatibility rules for such measures in the 2014 Environmental and Energy aid Guidelines (EEAG).\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_577\": {\"How did the Commission assess France's first payment request?\": \"On 26 November 2021, France submitted to the Commission a request for the disbursement of \\u20ac7.4 billion under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). The request was based on the achievement of the 38 milestones and targets for the first instalment, as outlined in the Council Implementing Decision approving the plan. They cover reforms in the areas of public finance, housing, mobility, unemployment insurance, skills, and health, as well as France's audit and control system for the implementation of the RRF. Several targets concern major investments in the fields of energy renovation of buildings, decarbonisation of industry, clean vehicles, research, youth employment, and education. In line with the RRF Regulation, the Commission had up to two months to carry out its preliminary assessment of the request. With their request, the French authorities provided detailed and comprehensive evidence demonstrating the fulfilment of the 38 milestones and targets. The Commission has thoroughly assessed this information before endorsing the positive preliminary assessment of the payment request.\", \"What are the next steps?\": \"The Commission has now sent the positive preliminary assessment of France's fulfilment of the milestones and targets required for this payment to the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC), asking for its opinion. The EFC's opinion, to be delivered within maximum four weeks, should be taken into account in the Commission's assessment. The Commission will adopt the decision on the disbursement of the financial contribution, in accordance with the examination procedure, through a comitology committee. Following the adoption of this decision by the Commission, the disbursement to France would take place. The amounts disbursed to the Member States will be published in the Recovery and Resilience Scoreboard. The Commission has also shared its positive preliminary assessment with the European Parliament.\", \"How do the milestones and targets achieved by France so far effectively support the green transition?\": \"The green transition is supported by specific reforms, such as implementing decrees of the Mobility Law to promote cleaner transport, and the \\u2018green budgeting' system, a reform to increase transparency on how public spending contributes to the green transition. Several targets that will support the green transition were also achieved. They include granting 400.000 bonuses for private housing renovation, the start of energy renovation works for 2.900 public buildings, the payment of 85.000 bonuses to buy clean vehicles, and the purchase of 1.291 electric and hybrid vehicles for the greening of the State car fleet. Finally, authorities validated seven research strategies to innovate in areas contributing to the green transition, with calls for projects to be launched in 2022.\", \"How do the milestones and targets achieved by France so far effectively contribute to the digital transition?\": \"While milestones and targets related to the digital transition are more concentrated in subsequent payment periods, some flagship measures are already included in the first payment. Strategies for key digital innovation technologies were launched in the context of the fourth Future Investment Plan (Plan d'Investissement d'Avenir, PIA). These promote the development of key digital technologies such as cloud, cybersecurity, quantum technologies, and 5G. Subsequent payments will cover calls for proposals and the financing of projects. Calls for projects have already been launched to support teaching, research and innovation ecosystems, another PIA measure, which will for example transform the education system through new innovations, in particular through digital technology.\", \"How do the milestones and targets achieved by France so far contribute to improving France's economic and social situation, and its resilience?\": \"France successfully implemented five milestones related to the governance of public finances and the assessment of the quality of public spending, which will contribute to the general resilience of public finances. The reform of unemployment benefits also entered into force with the introduction of new rules that should improve the overall resilience of the system. The reform should also help reduce the segmentation of the labour market, and in particular the share of workers on very short-term contracts. The resources of \\u201cFrance Compe\\u0301tences\\u201d, the national body managing vocational education and training and apprenticeship, will also be increased. Several targets were met concerning education and employment, in particular for young people. For example, subsidies were paid for hiring over 330.000 apprentices and 337.000 young people below 26 of age. France also created 16.000 places in higher education. The resilience of the healthcare and long-term care systems will also be improved by the simplification of the governance of hospitals and the creation of a new branch of social security supporting the independence of the elderly and disabled people.\", \"Does the achievement of these first milestones and targets contribute to an effective implementation of the Plan?\": \"The milestones and targets fulfilled constitute significant steps in the implementation of France's recovery and resilience plan, and of its broader reform agenda. They include important measures, such as reforms in the governance of public finances and the assessment of public spending, the adoption of secondary legislation of the mobility law, which seeks to decarbonise transport, the adoption of a bill to simplify and improve the governance of hospitals, and investments in railway infrastructure and the renovation of public buildings. France has also validated its control and audit procedures concerning the organisation and treatment of data under the RRF.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_22_348\": {\"What is the objective of the New European Bauhaus prizes?\": \"Applications are now open for the second edition of the New European Bauhaus prizes. Following the success of the first prizes in 2021, with more than 2,000 applications received from across Europe and beyond, the 2022 edition will celebrate new inspiring examples of the transformations the initiative wants to bring about in our daily lives, living spaces and experiences. By rewarding and putting real-life examples and young talents' great ideas into the lime light, the New European Bauhaus prizes aim to demonstrate that sustainability promoted by the European Green Deal can be inclusive and bring beauty and high-quality experiences in people's everyday lives and in local communities across Europe.\", \"What types of projects are eligible?\": \"The New European Bauhaus prize will reward both existing examples and new ideas and concepts in four different categories. In each of the categories, there are two parallel competition strands: The 'New European Bauhaus Awards' - for existing completed examples; andThe 'New European Bauhaus Rising Stars' - for concepts or ideas submitted by young talents Applications must demonstrate why and how the project/concept represents or embodies the three main values underpinning the New European Bauhaus initiative \\u2013 aesthetics, sustainability and inclusion - as well as innovative dimension. In addition, for the \\u2018Rising Stars', applicants must present the steps planned for further development or implementation of the concept/idea.\", \"What are the categories for the prizes this year?\": \"The categories are now four (compared to 10 in the first edition), reflecting the four thematic axes of transformation identified during the New European Bauhaus' co-design phase. They are inspired by the views and experiences of thousands of EU citizens and organisations who helped in that process. At the same time, they are broad enough to encompass different projects, ideas and concepts. Projects should contribute to beautiful, sustainable and inclusive places in the four categories, which are broadly described as follows: 'Reconnecting with nature' Inspirational examples of beautiful, sustainable and inclusive projects that bring individuals and communities closer to nature, that contribute to regenerating natural ecosystems and preventing loss of biodiversity, or invite them to reconsider their relationship with nature in a life-centred perspective, as an alternative to the human-centred one. 'Regaining a sense of belonging' Inspirational examples of beautiful, sustainable and inclusive projects that contribute to bringing a sense of belonging, a 'spirit' or 'meaning' of places, communities (where individuals belong to a group) or goods, and that celebrate diversity. 'Prioritising the places and people that need it the most' Inspirational examples of beautiful, sustainable and inclusive projects that contribute to addressing the needs of territories, communities and individuals that need a particular and urgent attention because of specific economic, social or physical characteristics. 'Shaping a circular industrial ecosystem and supporting life-cycle thinking' Inspirational examples of beautiful, sustainable and inclusive projects that contribute to the transformation of the industrial ecosystems towards more sustainable practices in a spirit of circularity, taking into account relevant social aspects.\", \"Who can apply for the New European Bauhaus prizes?\": \"Both EU and non-EU nationals/entities can apply, as long as their concept, idea or project is actually developed and/or physically located in the EU.

Young people under the age of 30 on 28 February 2022 can apply for both competition Strands \\u2013 the New European Bauhaus Awards and the New European Bauhaus Rising Stars. Project promoters who are over 30 years of age can only apply for the New European Bauhaus Awards.\", \"Can only tangible, physical projects apply for the prize or also concepts and ideas?\": \"Just like in the 2021 edition of the prizes, the first competition strand, \\u2018New European Bauhaus Awards', will be devoted to existing examples of recent projects. These projects must have already been finalised at the time of the application and should not be older than two years since their completion. Concepts, prototypes and solutions (tools, methods, ideas) that have not been implemented in real contexts are not eligible. However, these projects do not necessarily have to have a physical manifestation in the form of a building or a material product. For all four categories, they can also take the shape of realised/implemented methodologies or processes, such as, for instance, education models or cultural projects. The second competition strand, \\u2018New European Bauhaus Rising Stars' will be devoted to concepts or ideas submitted by young talents aged 30 or less. The concepts/ideas under this strand can be at different stages of development from the early concepts to prototype level, and should be presented with a development plan, outlining planned steps to further develop, promote and/or implement the concept/idea with a particular focus on the year following the application.

These risks include infiltration of organised crime, money laundering, tax evasion and corruption associated with such schemes. In addition, investor citizenship schemes that Vanuatu has operated since 2015 are commercially promoted with the expressed purpose of granting visa-free access to the EU.\", \"What are the Commission's concerns regarding investor citizenship schemes in non-EU countries with visa-free travel to the EU?\": \"The Commission is concerned about the risks that investor citizenship schemes operated by non-EU countries may pose to the security of the EU and of its Member States. In January 2019, the Commission published a report on investor citizenship and residence schemes, which highlighted the inherent risks of such schemes, in particular as regards security, money laundering, and tax evasion. While the European Union respects the right of sovereign countries to decide on their own naturalisation procedures, such schemes can have an impact on the EU visa-free regime, as they can be used to bypass the EU short-stay visa procedure and the in-depth assessment of individual irregular migratory and security risks it entails.\", \"How long would the partial suspension remain in force?\": \"If adopted by the Council, the partial suspension of the visa waiver agreement will remain in force until the risks for the EU and its Member States are eliminated or substantially mitigated. Once the EU considers that the reasons for suspension cease to exist, the partial suspension should be lifted. If the reasons for the suspension persist, the possibility exists under EU law for a permanent transfer to the EU's list of visa-required countries (Annex I of the Visa Regulation).\", \"Is the Commission planning to take action in relation to other non-EU countries with visa-free travel to the EU operating investor citizenship schemes?\": \"All EU visa waiver agreements can be suspended on grounds of security or public policy concerns. Investor citizenship schemes in countries with visa-free access to the EU may have an impact on the visa-free regime, as they raise security risks. The Commission continues to follow the issue closely in order to assess any possible security risks related to such schemes.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_7026\": {\"How does the own resources system work today?\": \"There are currently four own resources for the EU budget: Customs duties, which are levied on imports, collected at the external borders of the EU, and go directly to the EU budget. Member States retain 25% of the amount as collection costs.The Value Added Tax own resource, which has been simplified as of 2021. A uniform call rate of 0.3% applies to the value added tax bases of all Member States.The own resource based on non-recycled plastic packaging waste is the main novelty of the previous Own Resources Decision from 2020. Member States contribute \\u20ac0.80 per kilogramme of their plastics packaging waste that is not recycled. A correction is applicable for less prosperous Member States.The Gross National Income (GNI) own resource remains the main source for financing the EU budget. All Member States contribute according to their share in the EU27 GNI. Some Member States benefit from a gross reduction. The call rate is adjusted to finance the part of the budget not covered by other revenue sources. These four own resources account for more than 90% of revenues. Other sources of revenues include taxes and other deductions from EU staff salaries, bank interest, contributions from non-EU countries to certain programmes, interest on late payments and fines.\", \"Why is the Commission proposing new own resources?\": \"Following the unprecedented economic crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the EU agreed on NextGenerationEU, the largest stimulus package ever financed through the EU budget. NextGenerationEU currently deploys more than \\u20ac800 billion (in current prices, \\u20ac750 billion in constant 2018 prices), raised on capital markets, to fund specific recovery and resilience actions in a limited period of time, in order to boost economic growth and invest in a greener and more digital future. On 16 December 2020 the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed to accompany NextGenerationEU with a roadmap to introduce new own resources. The three institutions agreed that 'the expenditure from the Union budget related to the repayment of the European Union Recovery Instrument should not lead to an undue reduction in programme expenditure or investment instruments under the Multiannual Financial Framework' and that 'the institutions will work towards introducing sufficient new own resources with a view to covering an amount corresponding to the expected expenditure related to the repayment.'\", \"What is the composition of the Own Resources package?\": \"The European Commission proposes an amendment of the Own Resources Decision to introduce three new categories of own resources based on: the carbon border adjustment mechanism;the revised EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), anda share of the residual profits of the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises that are allocated to EU Member States following the agreement by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting to address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy (OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework agreement).\", \"How much revenue will the package deliver?\": \"According to the Commission's proposal, the new own resources will be introduced gradually as of 1 January 2023. Once they have reached their cruising speed, on average over the period 2026-2030, revenues for the EU budget are estimated to reach up to \\u20ac17 billion per year (in constant 2018 prices). These revenues will be used for both the repayment of NextGenerationEU and the financing of the Social Climate Fund. These estimates are subject to uncertainties, in particular due to the market price for carbon allowances over time and the need to work on the finalisation and subsequent implementation of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework Pillar One.\", \"How will the new own resources contribute to the repayment of NextGenerationEU?\": \"The repayment of the borrowing for NextGenerationEU will be spread over more than three decades, to be concluded by 2058. Sufficient revenue is needed to cover the Union's repayment needs for the non-repayable part of the borrowing, in line with the funding structure and repayment profile of NextGenerationEU. An amount of \\u20ac15-16 billion in current prices corresponds to a linear repayment profile from the Union budget for non-repayable support based on the Commission's issuance planning for NextGenerationEU, including the maturity structure. The three institutions have agreed that new own resources should raise an amount that is sufficient to cover the expected expenditure for the repayment of the principal and the interest of the funds borrowed under NextGenerationEU. However, repayments will ultimately be financed through the general budget as there is no \\u2018earmarking' of own resources in line with the universality principle of the EU budget. New own resources could enable repayment of NextGenerationEU borrowing already under the current multiannual financial framework. To that end, the Commission is putting forward a proposal for a targeted revision of the current multiannual financial framework, which would enable accommodating repayment of NextGenerationEU borrowing upon the introduction of new own resources.\", \"Is the Commission proposing EU taxes with this package?\": \"The Commission does not propose EU taxes with the amendment of the Own Resources Decision. The Emissions Trading System and the carbon border adjustment mechanism are market-based instruments; their ancillary effect is the creation of new revenue for Member States. The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework agreement tackles tax avoidance and aims at ensuring that profits are taxed where economic activity and value creation occur. A future EU Directive on the reallocation of taxing rights will support implementing the international agreement in line with requirements of the EU Single market. These instruments have their own merits. The purpose of the revision of the Own Resource Decision is to allocate a share of the revenues generated by these instruments to the EU budget.\", \"How will the EU collect the own resources?\": \"The modalities for the making available and for the control and supervision of the own resources are defined in separate legal acts. The Commission will make the relevant proposals in the first half of 2022.\", \"How do the proposals today relate to the Fit for 55 package?\": \"The proposed own resources are consistent with and complementary to the Fit for 55 package. The latter is a set of several legislative proposals aimed at reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. Emissions trading and the carbon border adjustment mechanism aim at achieving environmental objectives. It is appropriate that a share of their revenues is allocated to the EU budget, because they are pan-European mechanisms based on European objectives and principles. Furthermore, the EU budget \\u2013 including NextGenerationEU \\u2013 strongly contributes to financing the transition to a climate-neutral economy. In particular, a new Social Climate Fund will provide dedicated funding to investments in renovation, new heating and cooling systems, and cleaner mobility. The Social Climate Fund will be financed by the EU budget with a financial envelope of \\u20ac72.2 billion in current prices (corresponding to \\u20ac58.4 billion in 2018 prices) over the period 2025-2032. The total financial envelope of the Fund would in principle correspond to an amount equivalent to around 25% of the expected revenue from the new emissions trading system for buildings and road transport.\", \"What does the Commission's proposal mean for Member States?\": \"The Commission proposal achieves a good balance between the different needs and priorities of Member States: The package preserves the fiscal sovereignty of Member States. The Commission does not propose new taxes. On the contrary, only a share of the revenues generated by these EU instruments are channelled to the EU budget. At the same time, the package addresses fairness with the solidarity adjustment mechanism. Furthermore, the new own resources contribute to financing the Social Climate Fund which will address the social impacts of the transition to a low carbon economy. New sources of revenues are therefore indispensable for the adoption of the overall \\u2018Fit for 55' package. Last, new own resource are indispensable in the long term to maintain a sizable EU budget which will remain capable of financing, in addition to existing traditional policies, priorities such as research and investment, space and migration. Emissions Trading System own resource\", \"How will the proposed emissions trading own resource work?\": \"The Emissions Trading System is a pan-European instrument, which generates revenues for Member States. Today, this mechanism applies to the power generation and industrial sectors, as well as aviation within Europe. With the Fit for 55 package, it will be progressively extended to the maritime sector, while gradually by 2026 all aviation allowances will be auctioned. Moreover, the revision of the Emissions Trading Directive foresees a new Emissions Trading System covering road transport and buildings. The Commission proposes that a limited share of the total revenues from most of the auctioning of emission allowances and allowances not auctioned for which Member State have some discretionary flexibilities becomes part of the EU budget. The Commission also proposes a temporary solidarity adjustment mechanism to avoid an excessively regressive impact on contributions from the emissions trading for some Member States. This mechanism will notably limit the contribution from low-income and carbon-intensive Member States \\u2013 and make sure that higher-income Member States with a low carbon intensity pay a fair contribution.\", \"Why should revenues from emissions trading become own resources?\": \"The Emissions Trading System is a pan-European climate instrument, also generating revenues. Installations and aircrafts already covered by the system are subject to the same rules across the EU. There is a single carbon price across the EU for the sectors covered. Similarly, the new Emissions Trading System for building and road transport will apply across the EU. It is therefore appropriate that a limited share of the revenues from the Emissions Trading System is transferred to the EU budget.\", \"How will the solidarity adjustment mechanism for the ETS own resource work?\": \"With the new solidarity mechanism applied to the ETS based own resource, the contribution share of lower income Member State should be limited to one and a half time their share in EU Gross National Income (GNI). Similarly, to ensure that all Member States pay a fair share, the share of the ETS own resource should not be disproportionate to the relative prosperity of Member States. Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism own resource\", \"How will the carbon border adjustment mechanism own resource work?\": \"With the objective of climate neutrality by 2050 and the ambition to cut more rapidly European emissions by 2030, the EU needs to implement higher reduction targets in the coming decades. To ensure that the EU's effort is not frustrated by carbon leakage, a carbon border adjustment mechanism will be put in place in a way that is compatible with the World Trade Organisation (WTO). It will apply to iron and steel, cement, aluminium, fertilisers and electricity in a first phase. The carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will ensure that products imported from outside the EU incur costs for their CO2 emissions aligned with EU products that are currently subject to the EU Emissions Trading System. Importers will need to acquire a sufficient amount of certificates to cover the embedded emissions of their imported goods. This means imported goods should be priced, as if they had been produced in the EU. In case those goods have paid a carbon price at the origin, this will be deducted to avoid double cost. Such a mechanism promotes cleaner industries in non-EU countries, encourages third countries to introduce carbon pricing measures and ensures fairness for EU companies. 75% of the revenues stemming from the sale of these certificates will be transferred to the EU budget. Member States will consequently be able to retain 25% of the revenues generated by the sale of Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism certificates. The CBAM will start to generate revenues after a transitional period (2023-2025).\", \"Why should revenues from the carbon border adjustment mechanism become an own resource?\": \"The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism addresses the risk of carbon leakage and supports the EU's increased ambition on climate mitigation. It is compatible with WTO. Due to the pan European nature of this instrument, it is appropriate that the relevant revenues accrue to the EU budget as an own resource. Own resource based on the reallocated profits of very large multinational companies\", \"How will the own resource based on OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework Pillar One work?\": \"Pillar One of the OECD/G20 agreement envisages a reallocation of profits of multinational companies, from a number of sectors, with a consolidated global turnover of at least \\u20ac20 billion and pre-tax profit margin above 10% based on the concept of end market jurisdictions where goods or services are used or consumed. Member States will provide a contribution proportional to the taxable reallocated profits. Although all the details of the implementation of Pillar One of the international corporate taxation reform are not settled yet, the own-resources-proposal of 22 December 2021 demonstrates the Commission's commitment to ensure that this OECD/G20 agreement is swiftly and successfully implemented. Its use as a basis for an EU own resource can further contribute to the repayment of NextGenerationEU. The Commission has committed to propose a Directive in 2022 implementing this agreement in line with the requirements of the single market. The own resource will enter into force once this Directive should be transposed into national law subject to the ratification and effective application of the tax reform by international partners. Revision of the MFF\", \"Why is the Commission proposing to amend the MFF regulation 2021-27?\": \"The Commission is proposing a targeted revision of Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2093 of 17 December 2020 establishing the 2021-2027 MFF for the following purposes: an increase of the Multiannual Financial Framework ceilings for the years 2025, 2026 and 2027, for the Social Climate Fund proposed in July 2021 as part of the Fit for 55 package;the introduction of an automatic adjustment of the Multiannual Financial Framework ceilings based on new own resources actually accrued to the EU budget, which would allow for the possibility to start the repayment of NextGenerationEU borrowing as of 2024.\", \"Why does the Commission propose to increase the MFF ceilings for the Social Climate Fund?\": \"The Commission proposed on 14 July a new financing instrument for the period 2025-2032: the Social Climate Fund, with an overall financial envelope of \\u20ac72.2 billion in current prices, of which \\u20ac23.7 billion (in current prices) for 2025-2027. A corresponding increase of the relevant 2021-2027 MFF expenditure ceilings (which are expressed in 2018 prices) for the years 2025, 2026 and 2027 is necessary to finance the related expenditure for the new Fund. It is thus proposed to increase the ceilings by \\u20ac20.9 billion (2018 prices), which corresponds to the envelope of \\u20ac23.7 billion in current prices proposed in July 2021. In line with the Fund's objectives to alleviate the effects of the new emissions trading for buildings and road transport on vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users, the Fund is frontloaded to 2025, to enable Member States to anticipate the effects of the extension. For the period 2025-2032, the Fund will be financed by general revenue under the Union budget, which will include as of 2026 the revenues from the emissions trading for buildings and road transport as foreseen in the amendment to the Own Resources Decision.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6968\": {\"What did the European Commission propose?\": \"The European Commission has today presented an initiative to fight against the misuse of shell entities for improper tax purposes. Today's proposal will ensure that shell companies in the EU that have no or minimal economic activity are unable to benefit from any tax advantages, thereby discouraging their use.\", \"Why are shell companies a problem?\": \"Shell companies are often used for aggressive tax planning or tax evasion purposes. Businesses can direct financial flows through shell entities towards jurisdictions that have no or very low taxes, or where taxes can easily be circumvented. Similarly, some individuals can use shells to shield assets \\u2013 particularly real estate \\u2013 from taxes, either in their country of residence or in the country where the property is located.\", \"What will the new rules do?\": \"The proposed new measures will establish transparency standards around the use of shell entities, so that their abuse can more easily be detected by tax authorities. Using a number of objective indicators related to income, staff and premises, the proposal will help national tax authorities detect entities that exist merely on paper.\", \"What are the standards and indicators used to determine if a company has real economic activity?\": \"The proposal introduces a filtering system for the entities in scope, which have to comply with a number of indicators. These levels of indicators constitute a type of \\u201cgateway\\u201d. Today's proposal sets out three gateways (explained below). If a company crosses all three gateways, it will be required to annually report more information to the tax authorities through its tax return.\", \"How do these gateways work in practice?\": \"The first level of indicators looks at the activities of the entities based on the income they receive. The gateway is met if more than 75% of an entity's overall revenue in the previous two tax years does not derive from the entity's business activity or if more than 75% of its assets are real estate property or other private property of particularly high value. The second gateway requires a cross-border element. If the company receives the majority of its relevant income through transactions linked to another jurisdiction or passes this relevant income on to other companies situated abroad, the company crosses to the next gateway. The third gateway focuses on whether corporate management and administration services are performed in-house or are outsourced.\", \"What happens if an entity crosses all gateways?\": \"An entity crossing all three gateways will be required to report information in its tax return related, for example, to the premises of the company, its bank accounts, the tax residency of its directors and that of its employees. These are known as \\u201csubstance indicators\\u201d. All declarations need to be accompanied by supporting evidence. If an entity fails at least one of the substance indicators, it will be presumed to be a \\u2018shell'.\", \"What happens if a company is deemed to be a shell?\": \"If a company is deemed a shell company, it will not be able to access tax relief and the benefits of the tax treaty network of its Member State and/or to qualify for the treatment under the Parent-Subsidiary and Interest and Royalties Directives. To facilitate the implementation of these consequences, the Member State of residence of the company will either deny the shell company a tax residence certificate or the certificate will specify that the company is a shell. Moreover, payments to third countries will not be treated as flowing through the shell entity and will be subject to withholding tax at the level of the entity that paid to the shell. Accordingly, inbound payments will be taxed in the state of the shell's shareholder. Relevant consequences will apply to shells owning real estate assets for the private use of wealthy individuals and which as a result have no income flows. Such assets will be taxed by the state where the asset is located as if it were owned by the individual directly.\", \"Can a company deemed to be a shell contest this decision?\": \"Entities that do not meet all substance indicators will still have the opportunity to rebut the presumption of being a shell. They will have to present additional evidence, such as detailed information about the commercial, non-tax reason of their establishment, the profiles of their employees and the fact that decision-making takes place in the Member State of their tax residence.\", \"Will this pose a disproportionate burden on small and medium enterprises?\": \"The Directive does not create a disproportionate burden for any taxpayer. Small and medium enterprises are within the scope of the measures, along with larger businesses. The Directive sets out objective and straightforward criteria, which rely on elements readily available to taxpayers. The process primarily consists of self-assessing whether a specific entity fulfils the substance indicators and is mostly limited to providing answers as part of filling in the tax return.\", \"Will Member States exchange information on shell companies?\": \"Given the cross-border nature of aggressive tax planning, tax avoidance and tax evasion, Member States' authorities will automatically exchange information on all entities in scope of the Directive, regardless of whether these are shell entities or not. The proposal will amend the Directive on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation (or DAC) to this effect. Most importantly, the proposal will enable Member States to request another Member State to conduct a tax audit of any entity that reports in the latter State and communicate the outcome to the former Member State in a reasonable time frame.\", \"When will the proposal come into force?\": \"Once adopted by the Member States, the Directive should come into effect on 1 January 2024.\", \"How does this fit in the wider Commission agenda on tax evasion and avoidance?\": \"This is one initiative in the Commission's toolbox of measures aimed at fighting abusive tax practices. In December 2021, the Commission tabled a very swift transposition of the international agreement on a global minimum level of taxation for multinational enterprises. In 2022, the Commission will put forward another transparency proposal, requiring certain large groups to publish their effective tax rates, and the 8th Directive on Administrative Cooperation, equipping tax administrations with the necessary information to cover crypto assets. In addition, while this proposal addresses the issue inside the EU, the Commission will present in 2022 a new initiative to respond to the challenges linked to non-EU shell entities.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6967\": {\"What did the European Commission propose?\": \"The European Commission has proposed a Directive to ensure a global minimum effective tax rate of 15% for large groups operating in the European Union. The proposal delivers on the EU's pledge to move extremely swiftly and be among the first to implement the historic global tax reform agreement reached by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS). The proposal sets out how the effective tax rate will be calculated per jurisdiction, and includes clear, legally binding rules that will ensure large groups in the EU pay a 15% minimum rate for every jurisdiction in which they operate.\", \"Where does this proposal stem from?\": \"Minimum corporate taxation is one of the two work streams agreed by members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/G20 Inclusive Framework, a working group of 141 countries and jurisdictions who concentrated on the Two-Pillar Approach to address the tax challenges of the digital economy. They worked on a global consensus-based solution to reform the international corporate tax framework, which culminated in a global agreement among 137 jurisdictions in October 2021. The discussions focused on two broad topics: Pillar 1, the partial re-allocation of taxing rights, and Pillar 2, the minimum level of taxation of profits of multinational enterprises. As pledged, the European Commission is now implementing Pillar 2 of the global agreement, making global minimum effective corporate taxation a reality for large group companies located in the EU.\", \"To whom do the rules apply?\": \"The proposed rules will apply to any large group, both domestic and international, including the financial sector, with combined financial revenues of more than \\u20ac750 million a year, and with either a parent company or a subsidiary situated in an EU Member State.\", \"Which entities do not fall under the scope of the rules?\": \"In line with the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework agreement, government entities, international or non-profit organisations, pension funds or investment funds that are parent entities of a multinational group will not fall within the scope of the Directive on the OECD Pillar 2. This is because such entities are usually exempt from domestic corporate income tax in order to preserve a specific policy outcome. This may be because the entity is carrying out governmental/quasi-governmental functions, or to ensure that funds or pensions do not risk double taxation.\", \"How will the effective tax rate be calculated?\": \"The effective tax rate is established per jurisdiction by dividing taxes paid by the entities in the jurisdiction by their income. If the effective tax rate for the entities in a particular jurisdiction is below the 15% minimum, then the Pillar 2 rules are triggered and the group must pay a top-up tax to bring its rate up to 15%. This top-up tax is known as the \\u2018Income Inclusion Rule'. This top-up applies irrespective of whether the subsidiary is located in a country that has signed up to the international OECD/G20 agreement or not.\", \"Who will make the calculations?\": \"In the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework agreement, a transparent way of calculating the effective tax rate was agreed by all 137 countries involved. This is reflected in the proposed Directive. The calculations will be made by the ultimate parent entity of the group unless the group assigns another entity.\", \"What happens if a group is based in a non-EU country where the minimum tax rate is not enforced?\": \"If the global minimum rate is not imposed by a non-EU country where a group entity is based, Member States will apply what is known as the \\u2018Undertaxed Payments Rule'. This is a backstop rule to the primary Income Inclusion Rule. It means that a Member State will effectively collect part of the top-up tax due at the level of the entire group if some jurisdictions where group entities are based tax below the minimum level and do not impose any top-up tax. The amount of top-up tax that a Member State will collect from the entities of the group in its territory is determined via a formula based on employees and assets.\", \"Are there any exceptions?\": \"The rules provide for an exclusion of minimal amounts of income to reduce the compliance burden. This means that when the revenues and the profits in a jurisdiction are under a certain minimum amount, then, no top-up tax will be charged on the profits of the group earned in this jurisdiction, even when the effective tax rate is below 15%. This is known as the de minimis exclusion. Moreover, companies will be able to exclude from the top-up tax an amount of income that is at least 5% of the value of tangible assets and 5% of payroll. This is called a \\u2018substance carve-out'. The policy rationale for a substance carve-out is to exclude a fixed amount of income relating to substantive activities like buildings and people. This is a common aspect of corporate tax policies worldwide, that seeks to encourage investment in economic substance by multinational enterprises in a particular jurisdiction. This exclusion also focuses the rules on excess income, such as that related to intangible assets, which is more susceptible to tax planning. The agreement excludes from the scope income earned in international shipping, as this particular industry is subject to special tax rules. Special features such as the capital-intensive nature, the level of profitability and long economic life cycle of international shipping have led a number of jurisdictions to introduce alternative taxation regimes for this sector. The widespread availability of these alternative tax regimes means that international shipping often operates outside the scope of corporate income tax. These exclusions are not going to distort the calculations of the effective tax rate.\", \"Is there a transition period when it comes to the substance carve-out?\": \"For the first 10 years, there is a transitional rule where the substance carve-out starts off at 8% of the carrying value of tangible assets and 10% of payroll costs. For tangible assets, the rate declines annually by 0.2% for the first five years and by 0.4% for the remaining period. In the case of payroll, the rate declines annually by 0.2% for the first five years and 0.8% for the remaining period.\", \"Is the EU proposal different from the OECD Model Rules?\": \"The Commission proposal follows closely the international agreement with the necessary adjustments to ensure compliance with EU law and without any gold plating. The Directive will therefore adjust the scope to also include purely domestic groups, while the scope of the OECD Pillar 2 is limited to multinational (MNE) groups and a parent entity subjects only its foreign subsidiaries to the income inclusion rule. This departure from the OECD Model Rules is necessary in order to comply with the EU fundamental freedoms, specifically the freedom of establishment. The OECD Model Rules allow jurisdictions the option to apply a qualifying domestic minimum tax. The Commission proposal will also allow EU Member States to exercise the option to apply a domestic top-up tax to low taxed domestic subsidiaries. This option will allow the top-up tax due by the subsidiaries of the multinational group to be charged locally, within the respective Member State, and not at the level of the parent entity.\", \"What happens if certain countries outside the EU fail to apply the OECD rules?\": \"Within the OECD/Inclusive Framework, the rules have been agreed under what is known as a \\u2018common approach'. This would mean that Inclusive Framework members are not required to adopt the rules, but if they choose to do so, they will have to implement and administer the rules in a way that is consistent with the agreed outcome under Pillar 2. It also means that Inclusive Framework members will have to accept that other members apply the rules. In practice, multinational groups with subsidiaries in countries that operate a rate below the agreed minimum rate will ultimately also have to face the consequences of Pillar 2. This is because the rules test the effective tax rate per jurisdiction and apply a top-up tax to companies in the low-tax jurisdictions. As a result of either the Income Inclusion Rule or the Under Taxed Payments Rule, a Member State will collect the top-up tax due at the level of the entire group if some jurisdictions where entities are based impose tax below the minimum level and do not impose any domestic top-up tax. In other words, failing to apply the Pillar 2 rules will not protect jurisdictions from effectively being subject to tax at least at the agreed minimum rate.\", \"How does this fit in the wider Commission agenda?\": \"The Commission has a broad agenda to ensure fairness and transparency in corporate taxation. The Commission Communication on Business taxation for the 21st century adopted on 18 May 2021 sketches out a comprehensive vision for business taxation in the EU, taking the EU forward to deliver an EU business tax framework fit to meet the challenges of the 21st century and geared towards a well-functioning Single Market. The measures announced in this Communication together with the measures announced in the Tax Action Plan for fair and simple taxation adopted in July 2020 will complement the directives proposed today and contribute to more tax transparency in the EU. Moreover, by 2023, the Commission will propose a new framework for business taxation in the EU (BEFIT) to create a more robust but also business-friendly environment in the Single Market.\", \"What are the next legislative steps?\": \"Member States will need to unanimously agree in Council. The European Parliament and European Economic and Social Committee will also need to be consulted and give their opinion. It is important to note that EU members of the OECD Inclusive Framework are already supporting the global agreement that the Commission proposal is implementing. The only EU Member State that is not a member of the Inclusive Framework, and as such has not formally committed to the agreement, is Cyprus. However, we expect Cyprus to support the Directive.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6923\": {\"What is disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of former combatants?\": \"Disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of former combatants (DDR) is the process by which individuals or groups voluntarily lay down their arms, break away from military structures, and transition to live sustainably as civilians in communities. By supporting these processes, the EU helps address the risks of re-occurrence of violence and build sustainable peace. Whilst DDR processes may be incentivised, engagement is always voluntary and relies on personal, local and community ownership. These processes, which may take place at any stage of a conflict, bear political, socio-economic, cultural, legal, and security-related implications. To be successful, they need to be linked to long-term development and peacebuilding efforts.\", \"Does DDR mean a blank cheque for those who committed war crimes and other grave violations of human rights?\": \"DDR should never be equated with automatic amnesties. The EU remains firm in its position that individuals who committed serious crimes should be brought to justice in due course, and in line with national justice systems, reforms and related transitional justice, while complying with International Human Rights Law, including the rights of the child.\", \"Why a revised EU DDR policy?\": \"The last EU policy on DDR is the 2006 EU DDR Concept. While it has enabled the EU to support DDR processes in different ways in several contexts, there is a need to update the approach for three reasons. First, today's conflicts are increasingly complex and challenging, with a multiplication and fragmentation of armed groups that operate across borders and that may be designated as terrorist organisations, under certain circumstances, or maintain close ties with organised criminal networks. Second, building on the Integrated Approach to Conflict and Crises and the EU Global Strategy, the EU has a wide toolbox that enables it to better address the needs of former combatants as well as those of the communities where they (re-)integrate. Third, with a renewed political ambition to build and sustain peace \\u2013 drawing on its development and humanitarian action, as well as on its peace and security efforts \\u2013 the EU can better leverage its involvement with key partners, in particular the United Nations. The EU can act as a strong supporter of multilateralism in this field, as called for in the recently revised UN Integrated DDR Standards.\", \"What is the EU's added value in support of DDR processes?\": \"As a global political actor, the EU can rely on policy and political dialogue, mediation efforts, security sector reform, and development and peacebuilding efforts to support effective DDR processes. Through its principled and policy-driven engagement, the EU and its Member States will deliver tailor-made, sustainable and conflict-sensitive support to DDR by building on local realities and combining short-, medium-, and long-term actions.\", \"How has the EU contributed to DDR processes so far?\": \"The EU has supported the return of former male and female members of armed forces or groups to civilian lives, the release and reintegration of children in armed conflict, the prevention or reduction of violence at community level and, in specific circumstances, the integration of the vetted former combatants into the regular security forces. Contributions have been provided either directly or by channelling assistance through international, regional, national, or local partners, specialised non-governmental organisations and civil society actors, as well as governments, for example through development and humanitarian actions. The EU has also played an important role in donor coordination. Longstanding support to the peace process in Colombia, searching for viable exit opportunities from conflict zones in the north-east of Nigeria, working on the implementation of the peace agreements in the Philippines or in the Central African Republic, as well as supporting the reintegration of veterans of the conflict in Eastern Ukraine, are some examples of how the EU can support DDR processes.\", \"Will the EU deal with the reintegration of certain combatants labelled as terrorists?\": \"The Joint Communication makes it clear that groups designated by the UN Security Council or the EU as terrorist organisations or returning foreign terrorist fighters and their families cannot benefit from DDR support. Challenges relating to these groups are, instead, addressed in relevant counter-terrorism frameworks.\", \"How will the EU address issues relating to child soldiers?\": \"The EU pays particular attention to the protection of children associated with armed forces and groups. Within the area of DDR, the EU and its Member States work hard to ensure the unconditional and immediate protection, release of boys and girls from different armed groups and their (re)integration within their family and communities, when possible and considered in their best interest, irrespective of the potential designation of the armed group. To do this, the EU works closely with specialised child protection agencies in conflict settings. Children at the age of criminal responsibility, and who are suspected of having committed a serious crime, shall be handed over to civilian actors, and justice should be provided within juvenile justice frameworks.\", \"How will you ensure a gender perspective in the EU's DDR work?\": \"The integration of a gender perspective is central to any work within peacebuilding and development cooperation in general, and of particular importance to DDR. Men, women, boys, and girls of all ages have different and individual needs, capacities, and expectations, and it is important that these considerations are reflected in the EU's DDR work. Similarly, it is important to include and acknowledge the roles of youth in DDR settings. The EU Gender Action Plan (GAP III) for 2020-2025 integrates Women, Peace and Security as a core priority to be pursued.\", \"How will this policy be implemented?\": \"The EU is able to support DDR processes by bringing key actors together, linking short-term initiatives with long-term commitments, providing political and financial support to governments, partners and processes, and through CSDP missions and operations. Most importantly, all EU engagements need to be coordinated and specific to each context. To ensure this, the EU will develop structures for internal coordination, partner closely with international and multilateral organisations, governments and civil society actors, and develop the methodologies needed to ensure a conflict sensitive, gender responsive, adaptable and tailor made support to DDR.\", \"What funding tools does the EU have at its disposal to support DDR?\": \"The EU can draw on the full range of policies, tools, and instruments to support DDR processes through rapidly deployable assistance and specific provisions under EU external action funding programmes. The Global Europe: Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI) and, under specific circumstances, the  European Peace Facility (EPF) are key instruments through which the EU could provide conflict sensitive financial support and link long-term policy-driven development with short-term actions.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6912\": {\"What has the Commission adopted today?\": \"The Commission has today put forward a package of measures to ensure the continued long-term supply of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland and to address outstanding supply concerns in Cyprus, Ireland and Malta \\u2013 markets that have been historically supplied through or by Great Britain. The European Commission and the UK government have conducted extensive talks to find a long-lasting solution on medicines. The proposed bespoke solution reflects the outcome of substantial discussions between European Commission Vice-President for Interinstitutional Relations and Foresight Maros\\u030c S\\u030cefc\\u030covic\\u030c, and the United Kingdom Cabinet Office Minister, David Frost. It also takes into account the concerns raised by stakeholders, following our extensive outreach to citizens, industry and other business representatives in the EU and the UK on the issue of medicines. With today's proposed solution, the Commission is delivering on its intention to facilitate the implementation of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland on the ground, in line with the package of far-reaching solutions for Northern Ireland tabled on 13 October 2021. The EU has continuously engaged in good faith with the UK to find pragmatic solutions to help minimise disruption caused by Brexit and to help facilitate the everyday life of communities in Northern Ireland.\", \"What is your solution as regards Northern Ireland?\": \"The Commission has proposed to change EU rules to ensure that the same medicines are available in Northern Ireland at the same time as they are in the rest of the United Kingdom. On Generic Medicines (e.g. Paracetamol) Generic medicines will be authorised under national UK procedures, in compliance with EU substantive rules on medicinal products. Pharmaceutical companies will have the option of choosing either the UK authorisation process or an EU Member State procedure. If companies opt for the UK national procedure, the UK regulator will not have to agree the terms of the authorisation with Member State authorities and will be solely in charge. In such a scenario, authorisation by the UK regulator could allow companies located in Great Britain to use a single pack and single leaflet when supplying markets in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There would be no need for separate packaging. All regulatory functions will remain wherever they are now in the UK. This means that there is no need to relocate any regulatory functions or testing facilities from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Batch testing carried out in the EU does not need to be repeated when medicines are brought into Northern Ireland through Great Britain. On life-saving Innovative Medicines (e.g. new cancer medicines) People in Northern Ireland will continue to have access to novel, innovative life-saving medicines at the same time as people in other parts of the UK. A \\u2018bridging solution' will allow any new medicine authorised in the UK to be supplied to Northern Ireland, until the relevant authorisation is also given in the EU. Those temporary authorisations should be time limited and cease once a decision on the medicinal product is taken at EU level. Today's solution covers any medicine that may need to undergo assessment by the European Medicines Agency and be authorised by the European Commission. This \\u2018bridging solution' is in addition to the existing compassionate and emergency use early access mechanisms under EU law. On procedures for the supply of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland (applicable to all medicines) No manufacturing authorisation or import license will be required for bringing medicines into Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom. In addition, EU medicine unique identifiers \\u2013 that ensure prescription medicines are genuine \\u2013 will not need to be removed from prescription medicines that transit through Great Britain to Northern Ireland for another three years. This is a derogation from the rule that unique identifiers must be removed when prescription medicines leave the EU and are exported to a third country. This will avoid the need for affixing a new identifier when those medicines enter Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom and will allow more time for industry to adapt.\", \"Why are you also addressing the situation in Cyprus, Ireland and Malta?\": \"Historically, many medicines in Cyprus, Ireland and Malta have been supplied through or from Great Britain. The UK's withdrawal from the EU has made it challenging for operators in these Member States to comply fully with EU law. In order to address this situation, prevent shortages of medicine, and ensure a high level of public health protection, Cyprus, Ireland and Malta will benefit from certain derogations for a three-year period. For example, during this period in these three countries, importers of medicines from the UK will not need to hold manufacturing authorisations, nor will these medicines need to be batch tested again if they have already been tested in the UK. In addition, Cyprus and Malta will be able, under certain conditions, and for justified public health reasons, to authorise the placing on their national market of a medicine authorised in the UK. This will give operators more time to adapt. Work on a long-term permanent solution is ongoing in the context of the EU's Pharmaceutical Strategy. Today's notice requires the competent authorities in the UK and the Member States concerned to publish a list of the medicines in question. This is a way to increase transparency about the operation of the bespoke solution for Northern Ireland and the specific derogations for Cyprus, Ireland and Malta, with the ultimate aim of protecting public health in the EU and ensure that those medicines are not further distributed to other parts of the Single Market.\", \"What will happen in the interim?\": \"For the sake of stability and predictability, there will be an extension of the Commission's interpretive note to ensure a continuation of the supply of medicines to Northern Ireland as well as Cyprus, Ireland and Malta. Existing arrangements will therefore last until the end of 2022, unless the legislative procedure is finalised sooner.\", \"Does today's package cover veterinary medicines?\": \"Today's legislative proposals do not cover veterinary medicines. Discussions on veterinary medicines will continue over the next months in order to gather information, identify any outstanding implementation issues and find the most appropriate way forward to ensure long-term continuity of veterinary medicines supply to Northern Ireland, as well as Cyprus, Ireland and Malta. For the short term, however, the extension of the Commission's interpretive notice includes veterinary medicines. Existing arrangements in this area will continue until the end of 2022.\", \"What are the next steps?\": \"Today's legislative proposals will be sent to the European Parliament and the Council as soon as all linguistic versions are available. The Commission urges the co-legislators to start work on these proposals as soon as possible, in the interests of the people and businesses of Northern Ireland.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6916\": {\"What is an adequacy decision?\": \"An adequacy decision is one of the tools provided under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to transfer personal data from the EU to third countries guaranteeing a comparable level of protection of personal data to that in the European Union. It is a decision taken by the Commission, as a result of which personal data can flow freely and safely from the European Economic Area (EEA) (the 27 EU Member States as well as Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland) to that third country, without being subject to any further conditions or authorisations. In others words, transfers to the third country in question can be handled in the same way as intra-EU transmissions of data. This adequacy decision covers transfers of personal data to the Republic of Korea's commercial operators as well as public authorities. The benefits of an adequacy decision go beyond data transfers with the EU. Many non-EU countries, including Argentina, Colombia, Israel and Switzerland, recognise that the countries and territories found adequate by the Commission also offer an appropriate level of protection to meet the requirements for international transfers under their own data protection legislation. In practice, this means that, when benefiting from an adequacy decision, a third country like the Republic of Korea simultaneously enjoys free flows of data with a broad network of countries around the world.\", \"What are the criteria to assess adequacy?\": \"Adequacy does not require the third country's data protection system to be identical to the one of the EU, but is based on the standard of \\\"essential equivalence\\\". It involves a comprehensive assessment of this country's data protection framework, both of the protection applicable to personal data and of the available oversight and redress mechanisms. The European data protection authorities have developed a list of elements that must be taken into account for this assessment, such as the existence of core data protection principles, individual rights, independent supervision and effective judicial redress.\", \"How does the Republic of Korea meet the adequacy criteria?\": \"In the Republic of Korea, the processing of personal data is governed by the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA), which provides similar principles, safeguards, individual rights and obligations as the ones under EU law. A major step in the adequacy talks was the reform of PIPA that entered into force in August 2020, which strengthened the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC), the independent data protection authority of the Republic of Korea. This reform confirmed the importance of an independent data protection authority vested with effective powers as a central component of a modern data protection system as well as a key element of the growing international convergence in privacy standards. As part of the adequacy talks, the two sides also agreed on several additional safeguards that will increase the protection of personal data processed in the Republic of Korea. These safeguards provide for stronger protection, for example with respect to transparency (by requiring Korean data importers to inform Europeans about the processing of their data) and onward data transfers (by ensuring that data continues to benefit from the same level of protection when further transferred to third countries). These rules are binding and enforceable by the PIPC and Korean courts. Regarding the possible access to data by public authorities of the Republic of Korea, in particular for law enforcement and national security purposes, the framework established under the adequacy decision will notably rely on the strong oversight role of the Personal Information Protection Commission. Moreover, it will facilitate EU individuals' access to redress, by making it possible to lodge a complaint before the Personal Information Protection Commission with the support of their national data protection authorities.\", \"How does the EU benefit from the adequacy decision with the Republic of Korea?\": \"Europeans benefit from strong protection under Korean law when their data is transferred to the Republic of Korea, including through the additional safeguards that were agreed as part of the adequacy dialogue. The adequacy has a broad scope of application, covering both commercial operators and the public sector. It not only supports European business operators transferring personal data to the Republic of Korea as part of their commercial operations, but also facilitates regulatory cooperation between European and Korean public authorities. The adequacy decision also complements the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the European Union and the Republic of Korea that entered into force in July 2011. The trade agreement has led to a considerable rise in bilateral trade of goods and services. The adequacy decision will support this trade relationship worth nearly \\u20ac90 billion a year.\", \"When will the adequacy decision become applicable?\": \"The Commission adopted the adequacy decision on 17 December 2021. It is applicable as of the same day.\", \"Is the adequacy decision limited in time?\": \"There is no time limitation, but the Commission will continuously monitor relevant developments in the Republic of Korea and regularly review the adequacy decision. The Commission will carry out a first review three years after the adoption of the decision and subsequently at least every four years. Adequacy decisions can be adapted or even withdrawn in case of developments affecting the level of protection in the third country.\", \"With which other countries does the EU already have adequacy decisions?\": \"In addition to the adequacy decision for the Republic of Korea, the Commission has adopted adequacy decisions for the following countries and territories: Andorra, Argentina, Canada, Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Israel, Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand, Switzerland, Uruguay, Japan, and the United Kingdom. The Commission is also actively exploring the possibility of adequacy with other important partners in particular in Asia and Latin America, building on the current trend towards upward global convergence in data protection standards. The adequacy decision with the U.S. (EU-U.S. Privacy Shield) was annulled by the European Court of Justice in July 2020. Securing a new arrangement for safe transatlantic data flows is a priority for us and our U.S. partners. Negotiations are ongoing and have intensified in the past months, with discussions at technical and political level.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6888\": {\"What are the international and EU rules on ivory trade?\": \"International ivory trade is banned under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), with narrowly defined exemptions, for example for items acquired before elephants became protected under CITES. EU rules on ivory trade are more restrictive than the CITES regime in many instances, notably as they regulate domestic trade in ivory (within and between Member States), which is not required under CITES. Trade in elephant ivory to, within and from the EU for commercial purposes is therefore prohibited in general. It is only permitted under strict conditions for certain objects and types of trade where the risk of contributing to poaching and illegal trade is very low or non-existent. These exemptions are listed in the revised Guidance on ivory trade published today, which aims to assist EU countries in applying the EU rules that regulate ivory trade.\", \"Why is the EU revising rules on ivory trade?\": \"The revision of EU rules on ivory trade follows a commitment in the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, to take further action against elephant poaching and ivory trafficking globally in this context. While the demand for ivory in Europe is low, elephant poaching and ivory trafficking remain at dangerous levels internationally, driven mainly by remaining ivory demand in Asia. The revised Guidance on the EU regime on ivory trade complements the existing measures under the EU wildlife trade regulations, and helps EU countries, citizens and businesses fully understand and apply the rules concerning ivory trade. It also sends a clear message to the world that international trade in ivory cannot continue as any other trade.\", \"What are the rules on re-exporting ivory from the EU to other countries?\": \"Re-export of ivory from the EU is not authorised except in very few cases. Raw ivory can only be re-exported to non-EU countries for non-commercial purposes, for example as part of a cultural exchange between museums or as part of a household move. As regards \\u2018worked' ivory objects, i.e. ivory that has been embellished, carved, marked, or otherwise altered so that it can no longer be considered raw, only pre-1975 musical instruments, and antiques (dating from before 1947) if sold to museums, can be exported under strict conditions. These are the same categories of worked-ivory objects that can be traded within the EU with a permit delivered by Member States' authorities.\", \"What are the rules for importing ivory into the EU?\": \"Import of ivory is prohibited, except for very narrow exemptions. It is only permitted under strict conditions for pre-1975 musical instruments, and for antiques (artefacts from before 1947) if sold to a museum. Hunting trophies can be brought into the EU only if they were obtained legally and are for personal use. Individuals who own legally acquired raw ivory, such as a tusk obtained as a trophy, can continue to keep it. In both cases, it is not legal to sell them.\", \"Who has been consulted on the new rules?\": \"In January 2021 the Commission put forward a proposal to amend the rules on ivory trade after thorough consultations with Member States and stakeholders which included a public consultation attracting more than 90,000 responses. The draft Commission regulation and guidance were open for final public feedback. Following the public feedback and before adoption by the Commission, the proposal for the Regulation was subject to the opinion of the Committee on Trade in Wild Fauna and Flora and to scrutiny by the Council and the European Parliament.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6688\": {\"What are sustainable carbon cycles?\": \"The Green Deal is the EU's growth strategy. While we need to drastically reduce the use of fossil carbon, our economy will still need carbon to function. However, the \\u201cone-way\\u201d approach of extracting carbon from fossil reserves, using it, and releasing it as waste to the atmosphere is not compatible with the EU's objective of climate neutrality. We need to slow down, stop and reverse the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere that is in large part responsible for global warming, through three key-actions: the first and most urgent priority remains the reduction of EU greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. With the fit for 55 package adopted on 15 July, the Commission proposed a range of measures to reduce the EU's GHG emissions by 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 emissions, and to put the EU on a balanced path towards climate neutrality by 2050, as required by the European Climate Law. The measures aim to make our economy less dependent on carbon by improving the efficiency of our buildings, transport modes and industries, by replacing carbon-based energy with renewable electricity and renewable and low-carbon hydrogen.Second, by 2050 carbon will still be important in some sectors of our economy: for example we need it to produce sustainable aviation fuels, chemicals or plastics. This carbon should not come from fossil sources, it should be recycled in our economy from waste streams, from sustainable sources of biomass or directly from the atmosphere. The circular economy and a sustainable bio-economy can address this objective and should promote technological solutions for carbon capture and use (CCU) and the production of sustainable non-fossil carbon products.Third, we need to increase carbon removals. By 2050, each single tonne of CO2eq emitted into the atmosphere will have to be neutralised by a tonne of CO2 removed from the atmosphere. Yet, the amount of carbon annually removed from the atmosphere by ecosystems in Europe is on a declining trend and industrial carbon removal solutions are virtually non-existent today. We are not on track to generate enough carbon removals to neutralise the remaining unavoidable GHG emissions that we will have from sectors such as agriculture, industry or air transport by 2050. We therefore need a strategy to support the development and deployment of carbon removal solutions at a scale compatible with our climate ambitions.\", \"Which is the most effective strategy to remove carbon from the atmosphere?\": \"Carbon can be removed from the atmosphere and be sustainably sequestered through both nature-based and technological solutions. Improved land management practices enhancing carbon capture and/or reducing the release of carbon to the atmosphere qualify as carbon farming, as they result in the increase of carbon sequestration in ecosystems. Technological solutions aim to capture carbon from the production process or directly from the air, and transport it from the point of source to an adequate storage site where it can be stored for a long period. Both carbon farming and industrial solutions are necessary to remove several hundred million tons of CO2 per year from the atmosphere and will play an important role in achieving the EU's 2050 climate neutrality objective.\", \"How is the Commission planning to stimulate the uptake of carbon farming in the EU?\": \"To reach the proposed 2030 climate target of 310 Mt CO2eq of net removals in the EU land sector, as proposed by the Commission in the revision of the Land Use Land Use Change and Forestry Regulation (LULUCF), carbon removals have to be appropriately incentivised. A system needs to be established and promoted at land manager level in order to reward farmers and foresters for additional carbon sequestration they achieve. Currently, implementation challenges such as the financial effort required to put in place new management practices and the absence of robust monitoring, reporting and verification systems, limit the uptake of carbon farming across the EU. The complexity of measuring carbon sequestration combined with insufficiently tailored advisory services also leads to uncertainty about revenue possibilities for land managers. To address these challenges, the Commission will promote the role of EU public funding, in particular from the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), support access to advisory services and finance several costs inherent to carbon farming schemes and practices, and reduce the risks for land managers. The Commission will also support research and innovation under Horizon Europe, including through the \\u201cSoil Deal for Europe\\u201d mission, to further develop monitoring and reporting tools and digital solutions, and to promote combined approaches for carbon farming where public funding is complemented with revenues generated through the selling of carbon credits on voluntary carbon markets, with participation of private funding. Among other key actions, the Commission will also set up an expert group to exchange best practices on carbon farming with stakeholders and to support the development of EU standards for the certification of carbon removals.\", \"Do carbon farming and the bio-economy have negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems or lead to carbon leakage?\": \"Carbon farming practices provide important benefits for biodiversity and other ecosystem services and shall respect ecological principles favourable to biodiversity and natural capital, thereby ensuring environmental integrity. Carbon farming works in synergy with other Green Deal initiatives, being a key tool to implement actions under other EU policies, such as the Forest Strategy, the Biodiversity Strategy or the Long-Term Vision for Rural Areas. For this reason, carbon farming initiatives represent a win-win solution, where climate action can generate new income possibilities for land managers combined with environmental and social benefits. Given the potential synergies among policies and targets that create additional demand on the use of biological resources, industrial solutions such as Bio-Energy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) must not lead to excessive demand of biomass for energy, with its implications in terms of pressures on carbon sinks and stocks, biodiversity and air quality. The impact assessment accompanying the EU's 2030 Climate Target Plan showed that there is potential to reduce emissions and increase removals in the European land sector without affecting food security and economic growth, through technologies and good practices.\", \"What is the role of industrial carbon capture, use, and storage?\": \"The EU needs to rethink its sourcing of carbon as feedstock for industrial production. Fossil carbon should be replaced by more sustainable streams of recycled carbon from waste, sustainable biomass and directly captured from the atmosphere. Modelling shows that the EU climate neutrality objective could require capturing between 300Mt and 500Mt of carbon dioxide from those sources by 2050. The EU economy will use the captured carbon for the production of synthetic fuels, plastics, rubbers, chemicals and other materials requiring carbon as a feedstock. The construction sector has a strong potential in this regard: wooden construction can replace concrete, combining both the substitution of carbon intensive construction material with the long-term storage of carbon. The permanent storage of CO2 in geological formations is an option to mitigate industrial emissions and to remove carbon from the atmosphere when the CO2 is captured directly from the atmosphere (Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS)) or from the combustion or fermentation of biogenic carbon (BECCS). Carbon mineralisation, with the capture of CO2 in innovative aggregates is another example of promising long-term CCU products. The development of all types of carbon removals, including industrial solutions, should be sustainable and prevent negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems, especially when concerning resource or energy-intensive technologies. We need a strong EU strategy in this field to give the right signal to industries, circular economy and the sustainable bioeconomy having a key role. It should also address the infrastructure and open-access transport network required to transport CO2 from capture sites to use or storage sites across national borders. Research and innovation policies, Horizon Europe and the ETS Innovation Fund are instrumental to support the development and deployment in Europe of these technologies that we will need at large scale in the future.\", \"Why do we need a certification framework for carbon removals and what are the key elements to consider?\": \"An EU regulatory framework for the certification of carbon removals would allow the transparent and reliable identification of solutions that effectively and sustainably remove carbon from the atmosphere. Establishing common standards and rules for high quality carbon removals would favour a sustainable and cost-efficient deployment of removal solutions in the Union and minimise the risk of fraud and errors. This certification faces a number of challenges that need to be addressed. Carbon removals are at risk of uncontrolled re-emission (so-called non-permanence) and specific measurement difficulties, leading to uncertainty as to actual long-term removals. With regard to carbon farming, existing certification frameworks propose a wide variety of approaches to quantify the amount of carbon removals which are generated compared to standard land management practices. The future EU accounting and certification rules will set scientifically robust requirements in terms of quality of measurement, monitoring standards, reporting protocols and verification tools. This framework should ensure transparency, environmental integrity, and prevent negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems, especially when concerning resource or energy-intensive industrial solutions. It should also ensure comparability and recognition of the action started already on the ground. The Commission will present a legislative proposal for a regulatory framework for the certification of carbon removals by the end of 2022. Stakeholders will be actively involved in the preparation of the legislative proposal and the accompanying impact assessment. Among other actions, the Commission will launch a call for evidence to strengthen the Commission's understanding of carbon removals and key issues for their accounting and certification.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6684\": {\"Why do we need to regulate methane emissions from the energy sector?\": \"Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, second only to carbon dioxide in its overall contribution to climate change. It is responsible for about a third of current climate warming. In addition, methane is a significant contributor to the formation of tropospheric ozone, a potent air pollutant that causes serious health problems. In the EU, the energy sector is estimated to account for around a fifth of anthropogenic (human-made) methane emissions, but if emissions from imported fossil energy would be included this figure would be much higher. The most cost-effective methane emission reductions can be achieved in the energy sector. Furthermore, specific methane abatement measures in the sector, such as an obligation to detect and repair leaks from gas infrastructure and ban routine venting and flaring from the coal, gas and oil sectors, could deliver a large amount of additional reductions.\", \"Which parts of the energy sector are included in this proposal?\": \"This proposal covers direct methane emissions from the oil, fossil gas and coal sectors and from biomethane, once it is injected in the gas network. More specifically, it covers: oil and fossil gas upstream exploration and production, fossil gas gathering and processing, including inactive oil and fossil gas wells; gas transmission, distribution, underground storage and liquid gas (LNG) terminals operating with fossil and/or renewable (bio-or synthetic) methane; underground and surface coalmines in operation, and closed and abandoned underground coal mines.\", \"What concrete measures are you proposing to tackle emissions within the EU?\": \"The proposed regulation provides for (i) the highest standard of measurement, reporting and verification of energy sector methane emissions and (ii) immediate reduction of emissions through mandatory leak detection and repair and a ban on venting and flaring. The proposals on measurement and reporting of methane emissions, which build on the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 framework, will help us understand where exactly and how much methane is emitted. This means a shift from estimates to direct measurements, checked by independent verifiers. The urgency to tackle methane emissions is reflected in the proposals on mitigation that aim to deliver reductions soon after the legislation enters into force. For oil and gas, companies would need to frequently survey their equipment in order to detect leaks, and to repair them immediately. The proposal also bans venting and routine flaring, allowing venting only in exceptional or unavoidable circumstances for reasons of safety.  It allows flaring only if re-injection, utilisation on-site or transport of the methane to a market are not technically feasible. Finally, it requires flaring to occur under conditions of complete combustion. For coal, the proposal envisages a ban on venting and flaring of methane by 2025 from drainage stations and by 2027 from ventilation shafts, ensuring that safety aspects in coal mines are accounted for. The proposal also requires Member States to establish mitigation plans for abandoned coal mines and inactive oil and fossil gas wells. Methane emissions can continue many years after oil, gas or coal operations have ceased. Member States will be required to establish an inventory of inactive and closed or abandoned assets, for all three sectors. The inventory will serve as a base to prepare and implement mitigation plans. Where such assets do not have a company that is legally responsible for them, and ownership or liability cannot be ascertained, Member States will be the responsible parties. Methane emissions represent a health and safety threat to citizens. Therefore, the regulation proposes to allow individuals and organisations to submit complaints to the competent authorities of Member States if they suspect methane leaks. This mechanism, together with the power of competent authorities to carry out inspections, provides an opportunity to those directly affected by emissions of methane to bring their case to the authorities and to ensure a follow-up.\", \"What impacts will the proposed regulation have on the prices of fossil energy?\": \"Methane has economic value and can in most cases be recovered and used as a source of energy. For this reason, most of the measures proposed under this regulation are cost-effective for companies. Furthermore, given the cost effectiveness of the measures proposed (methane that is captured can be sold on the market), the methane abatement measures included in the proposal, are not expected to significantly impact energy prices.\", \"What level of methane emission reductions does the proposal aim to achieve?\": \"The proposal does not contain specific binding target reductions. However, according to the Impact Assessment for the Climate Target Plan 2030, the EU should reduce its methane emissions from energy by 58% by 2030, in comparison to 2020 levels. Today, methane emissions are covered under the targets in the Effort Sharing Regulation. Specific binding targets first require reliable data on the baseline level and origin of methane emissions, which is not the case today. Thus, the approach taken to achieve further reductions in methane emissions is to set mandatory prescriptive requirements based on best practice methane abatement measures typically used to mitigate methane emissions in the oil, fossil gas and coal sectors, which includes methane leakage detection and repair (LDAR) surveys and limits on venting and flaring. As reflected in the Impact Assessment accompanying this proposal, such measures are projected to deliver additional methane emission reductions (on top of estimated baseline emission reductions of 718 kilotonnes of methane) of 706 kilotonnes of methane in 2030 across the oil, fossil gas and coal sectors. This compares to an estimated combined amount of methane emissions for these three sectors of 1,797 kilotones of methane in 2020.\", \"How will the proposed regulation incentivise methane reductions globally?\": \"The Commission is already actively engaged in international efforts to tackle methane emissions, and recently launched the Global Methane Pledge in partnership with the United States; over 100 countries have now joined the pledge and committed to reduce their collective methane emissions by at least 30 by 2030. With today's legislative proposals, the Commission adopts a two-step approach to addressing methane emissions from imports of fossil energy to the EU. First, the Commission proposes a number of transparency measures to encourage significant methane emissions abatement globally and in particular in the countries supplying fossil energy to the EU. In the second step, the Commission proposes to evaluate the implementation of those measures to consider strengthening the requirements on importers to abate methane emissions. A requirement on importers of fossil energy to the EU has been devised to provide Member States with information on measures related to measurement, reporting and mitigation of methane emissions undertaken by exporters. This covers the application of regulatory or voluntary measures to control their methane emissions, including measures such as leak detection and repair surveys or measures to control and restrict venting and flaring of methane. On the basis of that information, a Methane Transparency Database will be set up, where the data reported by importers and by EU operators will be made available to the public, showing the level of commitment of energy companies and energy producing countries across the globe to reduce their methane emissions. Furthermore, a global methane emitters monitoring tool, based on most innovative satellite technology, will provide information on the magnitude, recurrence and location of high methane-emitting sources. To effectively tackle emissions of imported fossil fuels along the supply chain to Europe, the Commission will engage in a diplomatic dialogue with our international partners and review the methane regulation by 2025 with a view to introducing more stringent measures on fossil fuels imports once all data is available.\", \"How do these measures relate to the Global Methane Pledge?\": \"The Global Methane Pledge commits to a collective global reduction of human-made methane emissions across all sectors by at least 30% by 2030. This is to be achieved via a focus on all feasible reductions in energy and waste, as well as reduction of methane emissions from agriculture through technology and incentives for farmers. Signatories of the Global Methane Pledge also commit to using the best available inventory methodologies to quantify methane emissions and to improve the accuracy, transparency, consistency, comparability, and completeness of greenhouse gas emissions reporting. The Commission proposal contains a set of measures imposing obligatory standards of methane emissions measuring, reporting and verification across the EU. It also contains measures on methane emission mitigation such as leak detection, repair, and a ban on venting and routine flaring. These combined measures will significantly contribute to the EU fulfilling its international obligation on methane emission reduction.\", \"What is the EU doing to reduce methane emissions in other sectors?\": \"In October 2020, the Commission adopted an EU Methane Strategy, which set out actions to be taken across different sectors, with a particular focus on energy, agriculture and waste. In the EU, 53% of anthropogenic methane emissions come from the agricultural sector, 26% from waste and 19% from energy. Similar trends exist at a global level, with roughly 95% of total anthropogenic emissions covered by these three sectors. As a result, the EU Methane Strategy focuses its attention in these areas. A number of measures are being put in place in the agricultural sector to promote sustainable livestock management, including circular approaches, support feed additives and promote sustainable and balanced diets, with less red meat. For instance, the Commission is developing an inventory of best practices and available technologies to explore and promote the wider uptake of innovative mitigating actions. To encourage carbon-balance calculations at farm level, by 2022 the Commission will provide a digital carbon navigator template and guidelines on common pathways for the quantitative calculation of greenhouse gas emissions and removals. The Commission will promote the uptake of mitigation technologies through the wider deployment of \\u2018carbon farming' in Member States and their Common Agricultural Policy Strategic Plans, as from 2021. In the Horizon Europe strategic plan 2021-2024, the Commission is proposing targeted research on the different factors that effectively lead to greenhouse gases emission reductions, focusing on technology and nature-based solutions as well as on the factors leading to dietary shift. The Commission is also considering bringing part of the cattle rearing within the scope of the Industrial Emission Directive, which may contribute to curbing methane emissions of the sector. Methane emissions in the waste sector are covered by existing and upcoming planned reviews of environmental legislation. The Landfill Directive requires landfill operators to manage landfill gas, for example by using it to generate energy. In the review of the Landfill Directive foreseen for 2024, the Commission will consider further action to improve the management of landfill gas, minimise its harmful climate effects, and harness any of its potential energy gains. Furthermore, the ongoing review of the Industrial Emissions Directive is also considering the adoption of conclusions on Best Available Techniques for landfilling that would inter alia address methane emissions. Recent changes to EU waste legislation (2018) introduced an obligation to collect biodegradable waste separately by 2024, and set a new target of a maximum 10% landfilling of waste by 2035. As a result of these changes, it is expected that methane emissions from landfills will decrease further. Furthermore, the implementation of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive has helped to prevent significant methane emissions due to the collection and treatment of wastewater from inefficient centralised facilities.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6775\": {\"Why is the Commission proposing this strategy?\": \"Financial companies (such as banks, insurance companies, or asset managers) in the EU are required to report a wide range of data on their financial condition and activities to EU and national supervisory authorities. These authorities need these data to supervise financial institutions and markets in order to monitor risks, ensure financial stability and market integrity, and protect investors and consumers of financial services. Over the last decade, reporting obligations have increased in order to help address issues identified during the global financial crisis and also as a result of the ever increasing complexity and interconnectedness of the financial system. Consequently, the volume and granularity of data reported for supervisory purposes has grown substantially. While this has significantly improved supervisory oversight, it has also placed an increasing burden on both the companies reporting the information, and the supervisory authorities receiving and analysing the data. In a comprehensive fitness check of EU supervisory reporting requirements, the European Commission concluded that there are inefficiencies and gaps in the way these requirements are defined in EU law and data is collected. This can have an effect on the ability of authorities to perform their supervisory functions. It also generates unnecessary costs for companies and does not allow full use to be made of modern digital technologies. Digital technologies can significantly reduce the reporting burden for companies and allow supervisors to gain insights from the reported data more effectively and efficiently. The Commission is proposing the Supervisory Data Strategy to address the shortcomings identified in the above-mentioned fitness check and to enable supervisory authorities to seize the opportunities of data-driven supervision. The objective of the strategy is to modernise EU supervisory reporting and put in place a system that delivers accurate, consistent, and timely data to supervisory authorities at EU and national level, while minimising the overall reporting burden for all relevant parties.\", \"Why is this strategy being proposed now?\": \"Today's strategy contributes directly to the implementation of the Commission's wider European Data Strategy and the Digital Finance Strategy. The European Data Strategy highlighted the need for improved access to data and data sharing within the EU, and for setting up common European data spaces in specific sectors. The Digital Finance Strategy spells out the approach to establish a common data space in the financial sector, spanning across: business-to-business data (covered by the upcoming \\u2018open finance' framework as announced in the November 2021 Capital Markets Union Communication), publicly disclosed information (covered by the European Single Access Point) and supervisory data (this initiative). The strategy also delivers on recent Commission commitments to systematically and proactively seek simplification and burden reduction. Furthermore, by supporting supervisory convergence, the strategy contributes to the objectives of the Capital Markets Union.\", \"What are the key elements of the strategy?\": \"The strategy takes a gradual and balanced approach to modernising supervisory reporting. It contains both targeted sectoral measures and more far-reaching horizontal, cross-sectoral initiatives to deliver improvements around the following main building blocks: Ensuring consistent and standardised data that relies on clear and common terminology, as well as on common standards, formats and rules.Facilitating the sharing and re-use of reported data amongst supervisory authorities by removing undue legal and technological obstacles to avoid duplicative data requests.Improving the design of reporting requirements by developing guidelines based on best practice in applying better regulation principles in supervisory reporting.Putting in place joint governance arrangements in order to improve coordination and cooperation between different supervisory authorities (such as the European Supervisory Authorities, the European Central Bank, the Single Resolution Board, and the European Systemic Risk Board) and other relevant stakeholders, allowing them to share expertise and information.\", \"What are the main benefits for companies?\": \"Reporting requirements place a financial and administrative burden on companies. Streamlined reporting and the use of digital technologies would help companies reduce their compliance costs, thereby generating significant savings in the long-term. The Commission is proposing a gradual approach to the implementation of the strategy, supported by joint governance and close stakeholder collaboration, which will ensure that optimal choices are made and sufficient time for adjustment is provided. This will help to ensure that the costs associated with the implementation of the future supervisory reporting system are minimised and the benefits maximised for all stakeholders.\", \"What are the main benefits of the strategy for supervisors?\": \"The aim of the proposed strategy is to modernise EU supervisory reporting and put in place a system that delivers accurate, consistent, and timely data to supervisory authorities at EU and national level. Moreover, the strategy aims to create the conditions necessary for greater use of digital technologies. Digital technologies (particularly \\u201cSupTech\\u201d, i.e. supervisory technology) can significantly reduce the reporting burden and at the same time allow supervisors to gain much better and faster insights from the reported data. Finally, robust governance arrangements for designing, implementing and maintaining a modern and improved supervisory reporting system will enhance coordination and foster greater cooperation between different supervisory authorities and other relevant stakeholders, allowing them to share their expertise and strengthen supervisory convergence. The need for coordination and cooperation extends beyond the EU to our international partners. The Commission, in coordination with other EU authorities, will continue to support and shape international efforts to enhance data standardisation and alignment of reporting requirements at global level.\", \"What is the \\u201ccommon data dictionary\\u201d and what is its purpose?\": \"There is wide agreement that a common data dictionary is indispensable to promote consistent and standardised data across the financial sectors.  The purpose of the data dictionary is to avoid data and process redundancies and improve data comparability. It will also allow reporting entities to interpret more easily and unambiguously what data they have to report. Having common standards to define the format of the data will also make it easier to share and reuse data for different purposes. In addition, the data dictionary will contribute to other longer-term goals such as making reporting requirements machine-readable and executable. The data dictionary will be a repository containing a description of the content and format of all data collected under various reporting frameworks in a structured, comprehensive, consistent and unambiguous manner, using terms anchored in legislation to establish a clear link between collected data items and the relevant legislative requirements.\", \"What is the \\u201csupervisory data space\\u201d and what is its purpose? How will it function?\": \"In the European Data Strategy, the Commission highlighted the need for better access to data and data sharing within the EU and the need to set up common European data spaces for that purpose[1]. The supervisory data space aims to ensure that the data is reported only once and then shared and reused as needed by the different authorities overseeing the financial system in the EU. The supervisory data space will be based on a set of rules for determining data access rights and allocating responsibility for assessing data quality, as well as procedures to be followed by various authorities before adding, modifying and discontinuing reporting requests. It will also involve an IT environment, in which data can be accessed and exchanged safely, in compliance with data protection rules, irrespective of its physical storage location. The Commission has already proposed targeted amendments in certain legislation (e.g. Review of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD), and the October 2021 Banking Package) to facilitate efficient sharing and reuse of data by authorities. Working with the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) and other authorities, the Commission will, by 2023, review the relevant legislation to identify other legal obstacles to data sharing and stands ready to address them where necessary. This work will build on provisions in Union legislation which already provide for data sharing between authorities at both EU and national level under strict conditions.\", \"What are the next steps?\": \"The development of a modern and more integrated supervisory reporting system is an ambitious, complex, and long-term undertaking. For this reason, work on modernising supervisory reporting in the EU will take a gradual approach and will build on existing tools. This is in line with stakeholder expectations and reduces implementation risks and related costs. This pragmatic approach consists of both targeted, primarily sectoral measures that will have concrete impacts in the next few years and more far-reaching, longer term cross-sectoral improvements. The next key implementation milestones will be: the assessments by the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) to further integrate reporting and improve consistency and data standardisation within the respective sectors; the establishment of sectoral data dictionaries; the review of obstacles to data-sharing; and the formalisation of the governance arrangements. [1]  Data spaces were introduced in the wider European data strategy to mean concrete arrangements for data sharing and data pooling. See COM(2020) 66 final.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6686\": {\"What are the core elements of the revision and how does it deliver the Renovation Wave Strategy?\": \"Buildings are one of the largest sources of energy consumption in Europe. Boosting their energy efficiency would cut emissions, tackle energy poverty, reduce people's vulnerability to energy prices and support the economic recovery and job creation. The Renovation Wave Strategy (MEMO) presented in October 2020 set out measures aiming to at least double the annual energy renovation rate by 2030. The revision of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) is an essential element of this Strategy. It upgrades the existing regulatory framework to reflect higher ambitions and more pressing needs in climate and social action while providing Member States with the flexibility needed to take into account the differences in the building stock across Europe. The revised directive sets out how Europe can achieve a zero-emission and fully decarbonised building stock by 2050. The proposed measures will increase the rate of renovation, particularly for the worst-performing buildings in each Member State. It will modernize the building stock, making it more resilient and accessible. It supports better air quality, the digitalisation of energy systems for buildings and the roll-out of infrastructure for sustainable mobility. Crucially, the revised directive facilitates more targeted financing to investments in the building sector, complementing other EU instruments supporting vulnerable consumers and fighting energy poverty. In line with the Renovation Wave, this proposal introduces EU\\u2013wide minimum energy performance standards for worst performing buildings and leaves Member States the scope to set their own standards in addition. The proposal includes a definition of zero-emission buildings, deep renovations and mortgage portfolio standards. It introduces \\u2018Renovation passports' and facilitates the use of new performance metrics including final energy consumed and lifecycle carbon emissions. It also address other non-economic barriers to energy renovations and provides reliable building information tools to citizens and data to the public.\", \"How does the revision support other legislative proposals in the Fit for 55 package?\": \"The analysis in the EU Climate Target Plan indicated that sharply reducing emission from new and existing buildings is key to deliver on the EU's 2030 and 2050 decarbonisation objectives. Achieving this reduction requires regulation to make buildings use the least amount of energy, reflecting the cost of carbon in the energy mix and providing financial support for investments in renovation. This is what this revision sets out to do, together with the new emissions trading system (ETS) for buildings and road transport and the Social Climate Fund proposed in the  \\u2018Fit for 55' package presented in July 2021. The three proposals are carefully calibrated to work together and deliver the required emission reductions efficiently, jointly tackling the market and non-market barriers that impair renovations. The new ETS creates economic incentives for building decarbonisation and generates revenues for public support, targeted in particular to vulnerable households. The revised EPBD tackles non-economic barriers and ensures long-term demand. This will spur industry to innovate and lower renovation costs while supporting the mobilisation of targeted finance. The EPBD will likewise support Member States' efforts to achieve the enhanced national targets under the Revised Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) and contribute to the delivery of the overall energy efficiency targets set in the Revised Energy Efficiency Directive (EED). The EPBD proposal will also boost the integration of renewable energy in buildings, supporting the achievement of the indicative 2030 target for the share of renewables in buildings outlined in the Renewable Energy Directive revision (RED). The provisions concerning electro-mobility will complement the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR).\", \"How will the proposal support the phase out of fossil fuels used for heating in buildings?\": \"To ensure a decarbonisation of the buildings sector, the EU Climate Target Plan highlights the need to phase out fossil fuels in heating by 2040 when the direct emissions of the buildings sector will have to decrease by about 80%-89%. To encourage the swift deployment of heating systems with zero direct emissions, the EPBD proposal includes the requirement that zero-emission buildings do not generate carbon emissions on-site. As the lifetime of heating systems is about 20 years, the EPBD foresees that fossil-fuel powered boilers will not be eligible for public support as of 2027.  While the EPBD proposal does not mandate an EU-level phase out date for fossil fuel boilers, it introduces a clear legal basis for national bans, allowing Member States to set requirements for heat generators based on greenhouse gas emissions or the type of fuel used. Several Member States consider such measures essential to achieve a decarbonised building stock and to improve air quality and health.\", \"What are Minimum Energy Performance Standards and to which buildings will they apply?\": \"The EU Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) are a system to require the renovation of the worst performing buildings; those in Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) classes G or F. The G rating corresponds to the 15% worst performing buildings in each country, with the remaining buildings in the country distributed proportionately among the other classes between G and A which corresponds to zero-emission buildings. In particular, public and non-residential buildings will have to be renovated and improved to at least energy performance level F at the latest by 2027, and to at least level E by 2030 at the latest. Residential buildings should be renovated from G to at least F by 2030, and to at least E by 2033. Member States must then establish specific timelines for achieving higher energy performance classes through new National Building Renovation Plans, in line with their pathway to achieve zero-emission building stock by 2050. They are also empowered to set national MEPS, in line with their National Building Renovation Plans.\", \"What are Energy Performance Certificates and how will they be used?\": \"The EPBD proposal includes measures to make Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) much clearer, and more reliable and visible, with easy to understand information on energy performance and other key characteristics, to benefit building owners, financial investors and public authorities. Quality and reliability of EPCs has been steadily improving since they were first introduced in 2002. Nevertheless, there are recognised issues with regards to the quality of procedures and, particularly, the perceived lack of consistency. The proposed measures in the EPBD provide a clearer definition of what is considered a good quality EPC, its purpose and how it should be issued. Control mechanisms and visibility in property advertisement is improved. The EPBD includes a template for EPCs with a minimum number of common indicators on energy and GHG emissions, complemented with a number of voluntary ones, such as on charging points, indoor air quality and Global Warming Potential based on the building's life-cycle carbon emissions. The A rating should correspond to zero-emission buildings while the G rating corresponds to the 15% worst performing buildings in each country, with the remaining buildings in the country distributed proportionately among the classes in between. This will allow a clearer and simpler system of classification of buildings, while being flexible and adaptable to the national characteristics of the building stock. It will facilitate the understanding of EPCs also across borders. Finally, the revision also includes common requirements for the databases and the provision of public access to databases on the energy performance of buildings. This will improve the quality of the information available and facilitate the work of public authorities and financial institutions.\", \"Will this proposal lead to higher costs for home owners or industry?\": \"Energy renovation pays for itself over time, generating energy bills savings, which are generally a multiple of the investment needed to upgrade a building performance. Despite this, currently energy renovation often does not take place because of a variety of upfront obstacles. This can leave home owners and tenants exposed to higher energy costs and more vulnerable to energy price increases. This is especially true for those living in the worst performing buildings who are also often those with less capital to finance energy efficiency improvements. By targeting the obstacles to renovation, this proposal aims to lower costs for these home owners and tenants. It does so by focussing on buildings where renovation is the most cost-effective and brings the greatest savings on energy consumption, CO2 price, taxes and tariffs. A home in energy class G consumes on average about 10 times more energy than a nearly-zero energy building or a zero-emissions building. Upgrading these buildings through renovation to energy class F will trigger between 4.6-6.2 Mtoe a year in energy savings across the EU. An upgrade to energy class E will trigger about 2/3 more energy savings. Under the Commission's proposal, the renovation from level G to F on the Energy Performance Certificate scale would apply to about 30 million building units. The Commission is helping to mobilise the finance for the upfront investment costs for these units, with up to \\u20ac150 billion from the EU budget available to implement the minimum energy performance standards, between now and 2030. Finance comes from several sources, including the European Regional and Development Fund, the Cohesion Fund and the Recovery and Resilience Facility, thanks in particular to the strong \\u2018Renovate' flagships in national recovery and resilience plans. The proposed new Social Climate Fund will also mobilise \\u20ac72.2 billion from the EU budget for the period 2025-2032 to support households, notably those living in worst performing buildings. To enable an efficient combination of public and private financing, the Commission is also working to make the State aid framework more conducive to the needs of the EU-wide minimum energy performance standards. National Building Renovation Plans must also ensure the deployment of sufficient funds and support, to provide national-level finance and help leverage private investment.\", \"Does the revision of the EPBD stimulate increased funding for energy renovation?\": \"Lack of financing is one of the major barriers to building renovation. One of the aims of the newly introduced National Building Renovation Plans (NBRPs) is to ensure a coherent deployment of funds, identifying the key areas and putting in place the most adequate instruments.  NBRPs will pay attention to monitoring the reduction of people affected by energy poverty and of population living in inadequate housing (e.g. leaking walls or roofs). The plans will present an overview of national policies and measures empowering and protecting vulnerable households, of alleviating energy poverty and ensuring housing affordability. At EU level, there are several sources of finance to support renovation, including the European Regional and Development Fund, the Cohesion Fund and the Recovery and Resilience Facility, thanks in particular to the strong \\u2018Renovate' flagships in national recovery and resilience plans. The proposed new Social Climate Fund will also mobilise \\u20ac72.2 billion from the EU budget for the period 2025-2032 to support households, notably those living in worst performing buildings. This funding should be matched by Member States. Member States are also encouraged to roll out enabling and financing tools to make private investments more attractive and direct them to the renovation needs. To enable an efficient combination of public and private financing, the Commission highlights the need to make available technical assistance and is also working to make the State aid framework more conducive to the needs of the EPBD revision, in particular for the EU-wide Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS). In parallel, the Commission is currently reviewing the General Block Exemption Regulation, also as regards State aid for improving the performance of buildings. In addition, to avoid shallow renovations, the EPBD provides a definition of \\u2018deep renovation'. This helps to target renovation projects and support schemes delivering high energy savings, which will benefit from higher financial incentives and technical support measures. Private financing is also supported through strengthened information tools, particularly via the renovation passport, the energy performance certificate (EPC) and the databases for energy performance of buildings. It will help financial investors monetise the benefits of building decarbonisation and households or commercial actors to better factor in the economic benefits of building renovations and their repayment plans. New \\u2018mortgage portfolio standards' will be introduced as a mechanism to incentivise lenders to improve the energy performance of their portfolio of buildings, and encourage potential clients to make their properties more energy performing.\", \"How does the revision of the EPBD address the use of sustainable building materials?\": \"The construction sector faces the challenge of providing people with access to affordable and better housing, while reducing the environmental impact of new construction or major renovations. This proposal takes a first step towards addressing greenhouse gas emissions during the whole lifecycle of the buildings. The EPBD will address carbon emissions over the full lifecycle of a building, through mandatory calculation and disclosure of this information for new construction, to inform citizens and business and raise awareness. This approach builds upon experiences from several Member States and will be gradually introduced (starting with large buildings of over 2000 square metres as of 2027, and applying to all buildings after 2030) to allow enough time for data to be available. Emissions from the manufacturing of materials, transportation, construction, maintenance and deconstruction of a building are known as \\u201cembodied carbon.\\u201d Carbon emissions linked to the use phase of the building are \\u201coperational\\u201d carbon emissions. Making good choices about efficient building practices and materials can have a huge effect on both operational and embodied carbon emissions. This is why this proposal is not only about looking into reducing energy efficiency and operational carbon emissions, but is also the start of a forward-looking approach to match energy performance with resource efficiency, circularity and sustainability.\", \"How does the revision of the EPBD support the deployment of electric vehicles and bicycle use?\": \"The rollout of electric charging infrastructure needs to accelerate together with the expected increase of the electric vehicle fleet on EU roads, which is projected to reach at least 30 million cars by 2030. The AFIR proposal sets a target for the publicly available recharging infrastructure and the revised EPBD is complementing the AFIR with requirements for recharging infrastructure in private buildings, at home or at the workplace. It is expected that a large share of recharging will take place in these types of buildings. The proposal further requires Member States to remove barriers to the installation of recharging points for residents in multi-family buildings. The EPBD proposal also addresses another important barrier to sustainable mobility - the lack of safe bicycle parking - by introducing requirements for parking places in new and renovated buildings and in existing large non-residential buildings. The EPBD proposal introduces a requirement for recharging points to support smart charging, which is also in line with the proposal for the Renewable Energy Directive. With smart charging, cars can be charged when energy prices are low or when renewable energy is abundant. As technology evolves, it will also be possible to feed electricity back to the grid and use the car battery as a storage facility. Smart charging facilitates the integration of renewable energy such as wind and solar to the grid and helps decarbonize the energy system.\", \"How does the EBPD contribute to the increase of renewable energy in buildings?\": \"With this revision, the EPBD requires that in all new buildings, where technically feasible, 100% of on-site energy consumption is covered by renewable energy as of 2030, with an earlier adoption as of 2027 for public buildings. Member States should plan policies and measures with a view to a complete phase out by 2040 of the use of fossil fuels in buildings. The revision of the EPBD also provides enhanced visibility to the integration of renewables in the energy performance certificates (EPCs). The new template for EPCs includes the requirement to clearly showcase renewable energy production, how much it represents compared to the building's needs and how much it improves the overall building's emissions. Finally, the revision improves the recognition of renewable energy sources in the calculation of the overall performance of the building, particularly when a building is part of a larger energy grid, such as a district heating or cooling system.\", \"How will the revision of the EPBD support better indoor air quality and indoor environmental quality?\": \"Member States will retain the competence for regulating indoor air quality and indoor environmental quality. However, the EPBD supports high indoor environmental standards by requiring that new zero\\u2010emission buildings are equipped with measuring and control devices for the monitoring and regulation of indoor air quality. This is also the case for buildings undergoing major renovations. These devices will monitor and regulate the building's technical systems to ensure that they operate optimally and provide the required indoor air quality conditions at maximised efficiency levels. The energy performance certificates and smart readiness indicator will provide visibility to the buildings that have control and monitoring systems for indoor air quality installed.\", \"How are Member States performing against their current commitments and Long Term Renovation Strategies?\": \"The national long-term renovation strategies received by the Commission show that countries typically have measures in place for easier access to financing, technical support, promotion of advisory tools such as one-stop-shops, tackling energy poverty and better information. However, the analysis also shows that the measures are often not targeted or detailed enough to be able to compare the provided data and give certainty about their levels of effectiveness. In particular, the variety of different national milestones made it difficult to assess the ambition level of these strategies. Some national strategies were also lacking ambition or clear financial commitments to reach EU's decarbonisation target. Based on this analysis, the Commission proposed to review the long-term renovation strategies framework to foster more transparency, better comparability, better implementation and monitoring procedures, reflecting the higher ambition at EU level towards building decarbonisation. This is why the Commission has proposed new requirements in the EPBD proposal, including converting the strategies into actual action plans with a harmonised template, including national targets, requiring outlines of investment needs and financing measures, better synchronisation with the Governance Regulation framework and improved follow-up procedures on the national plans. The latter includes competences for the Commission to assess the national plans and take appropriate follow-up measures such as country-specific recommendations to Member States.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6745\": {\"Why is the Commission proposing a new Directive on environmental crime?\": \"There is a real need to strengthen the protection of the environment through criminal law. Despite the seriously damaging effects of environmental crimes, current rules do not tackle them effectively enough. Environmental crime is a growing concern causing significant damage to the environment, citizens' health and the economy within and beyond the Union. According to Interpol and the United Nations Environment Programme, environmental crime is the fourth largest criminal activity in the world after drug trafficking, human trafficking and counterfeiting, growing at a rate between 5%-7% per year, two to three times the pace of global economic growth. The current proposal is part of the wider package of initiatives under the European Green Deal. It aims at improving how the EU defines criminal offences related to pollution, waste and threatening biodiversity and other natural resources. By improving how Member States address the most serious environmental offences, the proposal will contribute to the Green Deal's overall goals of tackling the climate crisis, environmental degradation, pollution and loss of nature and will contribute to strengthening the environmental rule of law. According to Eurojust, illegal trafficking in waste and in wildlife species, pollution crimes, and illegal trading in hazardous substances are among the most serious environmental crimes. Yet, the current rules do not deter these crimes effectively enough. An evaluation of the 2008 Environmental Crime Directive carried out in 2019 and 2020 showed that reforms are necessary in order to make the use of criminal law more effective for serious infringements of EU environmental rules. In particular, the evaluation showed that with the Directive currently in place the number of environmental crime cases successfully investigated, prosecuted and punished remains low. Imposed sanctions are not always dissuasive enough and cooperation within and between Member States does not take place in an effective and systematic manner.\", \"What is the Commission aiming to achieve with this proposal?\": \"The Commission's proposal aims to improve and add precision, legal certainty and effectiveness to the EU's legal framework on environmental crime so that it sanctions the activities most damaging to the environment, provides better definitions, allows for a greater choice of adequate sanctions and a more targeted approach to applying them. These measures will improve the framework supporting the crucial work of crime-fighting professionals, such as inspectors, police officers, prosecutors and judges. An improved framework will increase the likelihood of serious environmental offences being discovered and successfully prosecuted. In the long term, this is expected to deter and reduce the incidence of environmental abuses and contribute to a culture of compliance with EU environmental rules across the EU. Increased compliance levels will help safeguard clean air, water and soil as well as Europe's endangered natural habitats and plant and animal species.\", \"What do the new rules propose on criminal offences?\": \"Based on the evaluation of the current rules in place, the new law proposes a wider range of offences and an increased legal certainty by providing specific and clear descriptions of the criminal offences. New categories of criminal offences proposed in the revised Environmental Crime Directive are: illegal timber trade;illegal ship recycling;illegal water abstraction from ground- or surface water;serious breaches of EU chemicals legislation;serious breaches related to dealing with fluorinated greenhouse gases;serious breaches of legislation on invasive alien species with Union concern;serious circumvention of requirements to get a development consent and to do environmental impact assessment causing substantial damage;source discharge of polluting substances from ships. The proposal also clarifies undefined legal terms used to describe environmental crime in the current Directive, such as for instance \\u2018substantial damage'. It suggests criteria that explain more precisely how to interpret these terms. This will lead to a more harmonised application of criminal law and understanding of environmental crime across the EU, and more legal certainty to duty-holders.\", \"What are the new provisions on sanctions and why are they proposed?\": \"The main sanctions for criminal offences are prison sentences and fines. The proposal recognises that, in addition, other sanctions and measures may be appropriate and necessary. The new rules propose accessory sanctions, such as withdrawal of permits, disqualifications and exclusion from access to public funding. Accessory sanctions are often deemed more effective than financial sanctions, especially for legal persons. Particular attention is paid to the restoration of the damaged environment. As regards sanctions for legal persons, similarly to the 2008 Directive, the proposal takes account of national legal traditions and provides that Member States may introduce sanctions, which for legal persons can also be of non-criminal nature. To ensure that punishment is effective, proportionate and appropriate, mitigating and aggravating circumstances are proposed. Aggravating circumstances include the severity of the damage done, the involvement of organised crime, the illegal profits generated or expected. Mitigating circumstances include providing the authorities with useful information that they would not otherwise have obtained.\", \"How will the proposal make combating environmental crime more effective in practice?\": \"More precise rules regarding the definition of environmental criminal offences and the type and levels of sanctions will facilitate the practical implementation of the Directive, lead to more successful detection, investigation and prosecution of environmental crimes and support more effective and dissuasive sanctioning. The Commission recognises that it is equally important to foster the effective enforcement of the rules. The proposal includes obligations of the Member States to provide for adequate training, resources, cooperation, communication and information sharing among enforcers. The adoption of national strategies aims at bringing together all the elements needed to make fighting environmental crime successful is also proposed. This builds on Council recommendations in the final report of the eighth round of mutual evaluations on environmental crime following a 2019 peer-review by Member States on the practical implementation and operations of EU policies to combat environmental crime.\", \"What is the role of the public and environmental defenders?\": \"The public is and has to be involved in combating environmental crime. Environmental non-governmental organisations have played a key role in addressing wildlife and forestry crime, for instance. There is a risk, however, that environmental defenders are harassed. The proposal, therefore, includes measures to support and assist people who report environmental offences and cooperate with the enforcement. It also enables, at certain conditions, the public concerned to be present in proceedings linked to the prosecution of crime cases where appropriate, pursuant the rules set out in Member States.\", \"How is the Commission stepping up the fight against environmental crime by other means?\": \"The Commission considers it important that, in addition to having an updated legal framework, Member States also have practical support at EU level. In 2018, the Commission created a high-level expert group, the Environmental Governance and Compliance Forum, to facilitate exchanges with Member States and with European networks of environmental inspectors, police officers, prosecutors, judges and environment agencies. These networks play a valuable role in sharing knowledge, experience and insights on crime fighting. With their help and the help of Member State experts, the Commission has prepared Guidance on combating environmental crime and related infringements. In addition, the Commission is publishing today a Communication on stepping up the fight against environmental crime. It envisages building on this cooperation and presents practical forms of EU support \\u2013 for example, use of the LIFE Regulation, which provides a basis for funding both the networks and individual crime-fighting projects. The Communication also recognises the importance of helping to combat environmental crime beyond the EU's borders and of cooperation with its partner countries and internationally.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6685\": {\"What are renewable and low-carbon gases and why are they important for the climate?\": \"Renewable gases are gases produced from biomass including biomethane, as well as hydrogen produced from renewable sources. Low carbon gases produce at least 70% less greenhouse gas emissions than fossil natural gas across their full lifecycle. Both types of gases substantially contribute to climate change mitigation, while renewable gases have a better performance in terms of carbon reductions than low carbon gases. Currently, some 300 Mtoe (350-400 bcm) of gaseous fuels are consumed in the EU per year, of which 95% is natural gas. They account for roughly 25% of total EU energy consumption, used for 20% of EU electricity production, and 39% of heat production. In line with the policy scenarios that underpin the \\u201cFit for 55\\u201d initiative, biogas and biomethane, renewable and low-carbon hydrogen and synthetic fuels (E-gas) will gradually replace fossil natural gases and represent very significant shares of the gaseous fuels in the energy mix towards 2050. Conversely, the share of natural gas is projected to be significantly reduced. The remaining volumes would be coupled with Carbon Capture Usage and Storage (CCUS) technologies. In most areas, direct electrification will be the most cost-effective and energy-efficient way to decarbonise final energy demand. Indeed, electrification coupled with an increased use of renewables, improved energy efficiency and applying the circular economy will deliver most of the emission reductions across the energy system. That said, electrification is not feasible in all sectors. Some will continue to rely on gases. This is why renewable and low-carbon gases have an important role to play to reach the EU's climate goals.\", \"How does this package fit in with the proposals adopted on 14 July?\": \"On 14 July 2021, the Commission adopted the first set of proposals to make the EU's climate, energy, transport and taxation policies fit for reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. The July package promotes the demand and production of renewable and low carbon gases, including hydrogen. Today's proposals (regulation and directive) enable the market to decarbonise gas consumption, and puts forward policy measures required for supporting the creation of optimum and dedicated infrastructure, as well as efficient markets. It will remove barriers to decarbonisation and create the conditions for a more cost effective transition. The present initiative is complementary to the revised Renewable Energy Directive (REDII), Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) and Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS).\", \"How will the package enable cross-border trade of renewable and low-carbon gases and facilitate their access into the market?\": \"There is significant potential to scale up the production and consumption of renewable and low-carbon gases, which make up less than 5% of the gas market today. The Impact Assessment underpinning the proposal has shown that entry tariffs are a significant barrier to the entry of renewable and low-carbon gases into the system. In order to address this the Commission is proposing to grant discounts of 75% on these entry tariffs. The Commission is also proposing to eliminate cross-border tariffs for renewable and low-carbon gases to facilitate sales across borders into the European market and exploit the most promising production spots. Similarly, in the future, no cross-border tariffs will apply for the dedicated hydrogen network, promoting competition, affordability, and security of supply.\", \"Will it be possible to integrate renewable and low-carbon gases into the existing gas grid?\": \"Some renewable gases are already integrated into and compatible with the existing gas grid, but they are often injected into the distribution grid where they do not necessarily have access to wholesale markets.  This is why the Commission is proposing to ensure that even smaller installations connected to the distribution grid will be given equal access to wholesale markets. It encourages also reverse flows of gas or alternative measures to commercially and physically integrate distribution grids to the larger transmission grids. Renewable and low-carbon hydrogen can also be blended with natural gas up to a certain percentage, but this requires that the quality of the gas is closely monitored.\", \"Will this package phase out fossil natural gas?\": \"The Commission's proposals creates the conditions for the gradual phase-out of fossil natural gas. The key objective is to facilitate the penetration of renewable and low-carbon gases into the energy system, enabling a shift away from fossil natural gas. The uptake of these new gases will also contribute to achieving the EU's 2030 climate objectives and climate neutrality at the latest in 2050. Whilst recognising the transitional role of fossil natural gas, the package encourages Member States to ensure that their planning is carried out with the decarbonisation goal and European Climate Law in mind and to avoid lock-in effects and stranded assets, ensuring a gradual and timely phase-out of fossil natural gas wherever electrification or a switch to renewable or low-carbon gases are possible. To avoid the lock-in of fossil natural gas, a limit is set for long-term gas contracts, which should not be able to extend beyond 2049.\", \"What impact will this package have on gas prices and security of gas supply in Europe? How will it contribute to better protecting the European energy system against future shocks?\": \"Whilst the main objective of the package is to foster the deployment of renewable and low-carbon gases, it will also have a positive effect on energy security and gas prices in the medium term. This is because renewable gases can be produced domestically and hence lead to a reduction of import dependency. An integrated gas market allows consumer access to the cheapest gas available on the market. The same principle applies to biomethane, hydrogen and other renewable and low carbon gases, ensuring consumers are protected and empowered to switch suppliers to make cost-effective low carbon choices. The package will allow to exploit the production cost differences across the EU so that the cheapest means of production prevails through fair competition. It is necessary to exploit the potential of the market in bringing the costs of production down. The package aims to increase the resilience and security of supply of the European gas system by extending the scope of the gas security of supply regulation. The Commission proposes to extend the scope of the regulation to renewable and low-carbon gases in the natural gas grid, while including new provisions on cybersecurity to ensure continued security of the European energy system. Moreover, this regulatory package aims to make solidarity between Member States operational through new arrangements and clarifications on controls and compensation costs. Finally, the security of supply regulation will be revised to enable more effective gas storage, to anticipate and prevent risks at regional level. This includes measures that can be activated for emergency situations, e.g. in case of an EU supply crisis, including forms of joint procurement of gas stocks. The measures will help ensure a high filling level of storage at the beginning of the heating period in the EU. The larger the volume of gas \\u201cin stock\\u201d the more the EU can compensate for temporary shortages of gas supplies or shortages of other primary energy sources. Ultimately, the roll out of domestically produced renewable and low-carbon gases will decrease the dependency of Europe on imports of fossil fuels and curb the impact of global market shocks, strengthening the resilience of the EU energy system.\", \"How will the package enable the development of hydrogen infrastructure?\": \"This package aims to create a hydrogen market with fit-for-purpose infrastructure and cross-border coordination, including interconnectors, where hydrogen can be cost-effectively brought from areas where can it be easily produced from renewables to the industrial customers that need it. Existing natural gas networks can be repurposed partially for transporting hydrogen, with significant cost savings compared to new-build infrastructure. Considering the nascent and local nature of hydrogen production and consumption in the early phases, we have to avoid the creation of natural monopolies. The package proposes rules on the operation and financing of hydrogen networks, on transparency of gas quality parameters and hydrogen blends, on the repurposing of natural gas networks for hydrogen transport, unbundling and non-discriminatory network access. This will create the right environment to invest in hydrogen infrastructure and develop a competitive hydrogen market. To ensure optimal development and management of the EU hydrogen network and to facilitate trading and supplying hydrogen across borders, a European Network of Network Operators for Hydrogen (ENNOH) will be established.\", \"Why is the Commission proposing to introduce a certification system for low-carbon hydrogen and synthetic fuels produced from it?\": \"There is an existing and upcoming project pipeline for the production of renewable and low-carbon gases in Europe, and consumers need to be able to differentiate between the available gases. Certification rules for low-carbon gas and its derivatives will complement the certification schemes for renewable fuels and gases proposed in July, and will apply both to imported and domestic production to ensure a level-playing field and avoid carbon leakage. Developing an international framework to create a global market for hydrogen-based solutions, including harmonised safety and environmental standards, is of vital importance in the EU's efforts to lead the clean energy transition. The EU is already in close contact with many of our international partners to identify the way forward, both bilaterally as well as in multilateral fora such as the Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM) Hydrogen initiative, the International Partnership for Hydrogen and Fuel Cells (IPHE) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).\", \"What is integrated network planning and how will it affect the development of renewable and low-carbon gases?\": \"Integrated network planning means that, at the national level, there may continue to be two separate network plans for gas and electricity, but both will need to be developed on the basis of a joint scenario covering electricity, gas and hydrogen. This is already the case on the EU level and it helps to ensure that there is a common vision between different energy vectors in the future. The package introduces an additional national network planning for hydrogen and an EU-wide ten-year network development plan. The latter will include the modelling of an integrated network, build on national hydrogen network plans, national investment plans, cross-border interconnectors, and identify gaps in investments especially with regards to cross-border capacities. At the same time, integration will also take place vertically, as distribution system operators and district heating infrastructure operators are required to exchange relevant information for the purpose of developing the plan. The plan should also avoid the development of stranded assets, and provide transparency on network parts that are not needed anymore and could be used for transporting hydrogen in the future, as well as providing indications for the optimal size and location of power-to-gas installations such as electrolysers. This will help to integrate renewable and low carbon gases.\", \"How will the package address consumers' needs?\": \"For new gases to play a full role in the energy transition, the retail market rules should empower customers to make sustainable and low carbon choices, minimise barriers to switching suppliers, and increase the level of customer engagement and protection. Currently, the retail gas markets exhibit market concentration and low levels of new entry and innovation; this prevents customers from benefiting from open competition. To be empowered, customers need sufficient information on their energy consumption and its origin, as well as efficient tools to participate in the market. Today's proposals mirror most of the provisions on consumer protection and empowerment in the electricity sector, wherever they are adaptable to the gas market. With the new rules, consumers may switch suppliers more easily, use effective price comparison tools, get accurate, fair and transparent billing, have better access to data and new smart technology, can act as active customers and participate in citizen energy communities operating on a level playing field. Moreover, Member States should take the appropriate and necessary measures to protect and support vulnerable and energy poor customers through energy efficiency improvements and social security systems amongst others. The decarbonised gas market should not be developed without them being able to fully benefit from it.\", \"11.How will the package improve the functioning of storage in the EU and facilitate joint procurement of strategic stocks?\": \"The package includes provisions on efficient use of gas storage and on voluntary joint procurement. Member States shall include an analysis of their storage levels and of potential risks related to security of supply, also from when storage is owned by third-country entities in their common risk assessment at regional level. Whenever risks will be identified they will have to introduce possible counter-measures from a range of options, including minimum storage obligations, tendering or auctions. Member States will have to agree on the procedures to activate these measures and on the joint financing. They will benefit from facilitated cross-border exchanges of gas and cross-border transparent access to storage facilities. The proposal also enables Member States who wish to do so, to set up a to set up a mechanisms for voluntary joint procurement by Transmission System Operators (TSOs) of strategic gas stocks, which could be released in case of emergency. The voluntary mechanism should be in line with the energy market and competition rules and open to the participation at a later stage of other Member States who wish to do so. Furthermore, the Commission has already set up new cross-border regional gas risk groups to analyse gas supply risks across the EU. The risk groups will advise Member States on the design of their preventive and emergency action plans, and will emphasis the role of gas storage.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6729\": {\"What is the aim of the new European Urban Mobility Framework?\": \"Over 70% of EU citizens live in cities which generate 23% of all transport greenhouse gas emissions. The Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy stresses the need for inter-urban and urban mobility to become more sustainable, smart and healthy. To this end, the Commission is proposing a new urban mobility initiative. The new urban mobility initiative complements the proposal for revised guidelines for the Trans-European >Transport Network (TEN-T revision). That proposal foresees that all major cities (\\u2018urban nodes') on that network must develop by 2025 a sustainable urban mobility plan. The new European Urban Mobility Framework outlines a common a list of measures and initiatives for these cities, as well as the remaining cities in the EU, to meet the challenge of making their mobility more sustainable. Its objectives include: contributing to EU Green House Gas reduction targets as set in the Climate Law (including -55% by 2030)improving transport and mobility to, in and around cities as well as improving the efficiency of goods and home deliveries. This is done by: setting a common European framework with measures including guidance how to address air pollution, congestion, accessibility, urban road safety, growth of e-commerce, and other urban mobility challenges.increasing the support for, and share of, sustainable transport modes (in particular public transport and active mobility such as walking and cycling) as well as zero-emission urban logistics;promoting a coherent and integrated approach to ensure high-quality sustainable urban mobility plans;better monitoring progress in implementing urban mobility policies and measures with a coherent approach to sustainable urban mobility data collection;fostering the integration of innovative mobility services into urban transport systems and increased digitalisation for sustainable urban mobilitymaintaining long-term competitiveness and technology leadership in the urban transport sector;strengthening involvement of all Member States and building continuous dialogue with cities, regions and other stakeholders on all major urban mobility issues.\", \"What are the key elements of the new EU Urban Mobility Framework?\": \"The new framework announces: A more ambitious approach to sustainable urban mobility planning and related indicators. This links with new requirements put forward in the revised TEN-T Regulation for the largest 424 EU cities on the TEN-T network to adopt a sustainable urban mobility plan (SUMP) and collect relevant data.This links also with a planned Commission Recommendation in 2022 to Member States on a national support programme for rolling out SUMPs with public transport and active mobility (walking, cycling) at its heart. This will bring urban transport one step closer to climate-neutral mobility. Many towns, cities and regions throughout the EU had previously taken action, with over 1,000 SUMPs (or similar plans) currently in place.Stronger action to create climate-neutral cities. Action points cover making urban transport resilient, environmentally-friendly and energy-efficient and identifying zero-emission solutions for urban logistics. This will be achieved, inter alia, by obligations on putting in place of recharging and refuelling infrastructure for electric and hydrogen vehicles in cities as well as improved coordination and dedicated funding for cities under the Climate-neutral and Smart Cities mission. More targeted EU funding and better synergies between different programmes to support these action points. For example, under the EU's Horizon Europe research and innovation programme, we recently kicked-off a \\u2018Mission' to create 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030, turning these cities into living labs that inspire all other cities.New measures to promote active mobility and protect vulnerable road users in the form of a greater focus on walking and cycling in revised SUMP guidance documents, guidance on the safe use of micromobility devices, and guidance on quality infrastructure for vulnerable road users.More effective zero-emission city freight logistics and last-mile deliveries thanks to the integration of sustainable urban logistics plans (SULPs) within the SUMP framework, and voluntary data sharing between all types of stakeholder;Guidance (in Q1 2022) on passenger transport-on-demand (taxis and Private Hire Vehicles with drivers (PHV) so it can become more sustainable and deliver efficient services to citizens while maintaining helping the single market to function smoothly and addressing social and safety concerns.Accelerate digitalisation and innovation by incorporating urban mobility in the work on the provision and processing of commercially-sensitive data for multimodal digital mobility services such as Mobility as a Service (MaaS) applications, and on a common European mobility data space to facilitate access to and sharing of mobility data, and by further developing the CIVITAS Initiative in coherence with other urban initiatives.Moreover, a detailed study will be undertaken in 2022 to map and clarify which digital solutions would be available to enable more effective and user-friendly low-emission zones and other types of urban vehicle access regulationEfforts to increase awareness and reinforce citizen engagement within and beyond the EU, through e.g. the European Mobility Week campaign and the EU urban mobility awards and events.A reformed EU-level group that involves cities, regions Member States and urban mobility stakeholders more closely.\", \"What is a Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP)?\": \"Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans, as defined by the Urban Mobility Package of 2013, are a cornerstone of mobility within the EU's towns and cities. These strategic plans are designed to ensure that the mobility needs of people and businesses in cities and their surroundings are met, and that quality of life improves. It should include targets towards making local transport more sustainable, safe and inclusive and be adopted by relevant political authority.   They build on existing planning practices and take due consideration of involvement and participation of all relevant stakeholders and the general public, and proper monitoring and evaluation principles. Eltis, the EU urban mobility observatory, provides a wealth of information, including on SUMPs: guidance documents, city database, self-assessment tool, best practice examples, and more.\", \"What is the link between EU Urban Mobility framework and the TEN-T revision?\": \"The revised TEN-T Regulation proposes to strengthen the role of cities on the Trans-European Transport (TEN-T) Network as vital enablers of sustainable, efficient and multimodal transport. In particular, more than 424 large and medium-sized cities should develop their own SUMP by 2025 and collect relevant urban mobility data. Under the current TEN-T regulation, having a SUMP is a voluntary engagement. Moreover, by 2025 these 424 cities should also have multimodal passenger hubs, including park and ride facilities, to improve first and last mile connections and to enhance the necessary capacities for long-distance connectivity via rail and other transport modes in and between cities. They also need to have multimodal freight terminals in place to ensure sustainable urban logistics.\", \"Why is there a need for a new EU Urban Mobility Framework?\": \"Since the first Urban Mobility Package of 2013, a lot has changed. In particular, the EU's increasingly ambitious climate, environmental, digital, health and societal objectives ask for more decisive action on urban mobility; for a shift away from the current approach based on traffic flow to an approach based on moving people and goods more sustainably. This means cities need to improve collective and public transport, provide better active mobility (walking, cycling) options, and implement efficient zero-emission urban logistics and last mile deliveries, taking into account the needs of people and businesses who need to access the city for work, leisure, shopping or tourism. In particular, more ambitious EU action is necessary to meet the increasingly ambitious global commitments, such as the Paris Agreement on climate. As provided in the Union's 2030 Climate Target Plan, transition to zero-emission mobility in urban context is indispensable to meet EU goals and therefore a strengthened EU urban mobility framework is needed. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated trends favouring micromobility and digital mobility services as well as home deliveries.\", \"Will the Commission become more involved in regulating / harmonising low-emission zones and other types of Urban Vehicle Access Regulations Schemes (UVARs)?\": \"Many cities are struggling with local road congestion and air quality issues caused by transport, frequently exceeding EU air quality standards and pollution thresholds. Urban vehicle access regulations (UVARs) are an important way to tackle this challenge. In Europe, the majority (73%) of the more that 500 UVARs concern low (and zero) emission zones. Low-emission zones can be an effective tool to address local air quality problems, especially for areas where traffic is a dominant source of overall air pollution. When it comes to congestion, the situation across EU cities has not improved in recent years, and, in many places, has worsened, with very considerable costs to society: urban congestion costs are estimated to account for \\u20ac180 billion per year in the EU. The new EU Urban Mobility Framework recognises challenges faced by cities and users. We will map out and clarify which digital and technical solutions could be available to enable more effective and user-friendly UVARs.\", \"How does the Commission help cities to adopt a smarter and more sustainable approach to urban mobility issues?\": \"The Commission's 2013 Urban Mobility Package made recommendations for coordinated action between all levels of government and between the public and the private sectors. Taking this into account, the Commission is supporting cities through: Targeted funding: \\u20ac18.5 billion was awarded to urban projects in 2014-2020, including via CEF, H2020, ESIF, ELENA.Technical assistance: for example via the European Investment Bank joint support programme JASPERS.Sustainable urban mobility plan (SUMP) guidelines and accompanying guidance documents for cities to help promote multimodality, active mobility and shared mobility. The development of SUMPs will be a focal point within the new framework.Information and awareness raising via a variety of tools and channels: EU urban mobility observatory ELTIS; European Mobility Week; the CIVITAS initiative, and annual awards and events. Other related transport policies and legislation also support the transition to more sustainable urban mobility, in particular in the field of intelligent transport systems, alternative fuels and clean transport, and road safety.\", \"What is the Commission's approach to new mobility services, including \\u2018micro-mobility' (e.g. e-bikes/e-scooters)? How does this link with EU urban mobility policy?\": \"New mobility services are part of a multimodal, integrated approach to sustainable urban mobility. They can reinforce public transport and substitute car use. The \\u2018micro-mobility revolution' requires more effort in terms of sharing best practice and providing guidance, especially as these vehicles pose significant safety challenges. Some e-bikes and electric scooters fall under EU type-approval rules (depending on the power of the engine, whether it is at least partially \\u2018human-powered', and whether there is seating position). In the case of traffic and road safety rules, it is for Member States to decide if, where and under which conditions these bicycles, e-bikes, scooters, \\u2018segways', monowheels, etc. can circulate. Some guidance is already available online, and a dedicated SUMP guidance document on the safety of micro-mobility will be published in December 2021. In addition, building on experience at national and local levels on safety requirements, the Commission will prepare rules on the safety of micromobility devices.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6727\": {\"What are Intelligent Transport Systems?\": \"Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) apply information and communication technologies such as journey planners, eCall, and automated driving in transport, making mobility safer, more efficient and more sustainable. With ITS, citizens can receive better information through applications in the car, e.g. on traffic regulations and roadworks. Systems like eCall, which automatically alert emergency services in case of an accident, are already installed in 12 million cars. ITS thus leads to an overall safer and more efficient and comfortable driving experience. A smarter and interoperable transport system allows more effective management of traffic and mobility across transport modes, facilitating combining the most sustainable modes of transport. For instance, mobile apps are proposing travellers different transport options to get to their destination. Also, transport operators will share their insights with authorities for better mobility management decisions.  In turn, this will reduce congestion and bring down emissions. ITS are therefore vital to tackle Europe's growing emission and congestion problems, and can enable entirely new services and jobs. But in order to be effective, the roll-out of ITS needs to be coherent and properly coordinated across the EU.\", \"What changes to the ITS Directive are proposed and why?\": \"Since 2010, the ITS Directive has been the EU's tool to ensure the coordinated deployment of such systems across the EU, based on European specifications and standards.  The revision includes an extension in the Directive's scope to better encompass emerging services, such as multimodal information, booking and ticketing services (such as apps to find and book journeys that combine public transport, shared car or bike services), communication between vehicles and infrastructure (to increase safety) and automated mobility. It also mandates the collection of crucial data and the provision of essential services such as realtime information services informing the driver about accidents or obstacles on the road.\", \"How does digitalisation fit into the wider transport policy?\": \"The digital transformation of the transport sector is essential for reaching our sustainability and transport efficiency goals (alongside other objectives). The Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy lays out how Europe can achieve this digital transformation, and includes milestones such as deploying automated mobility at large scale by 2030 and eliminating fatalities in all transport modes by 2050. This Strategy identifies the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) as a key action to achieve these goals, together with the digital transformation of the European transport system.\", \"How are you protecting personal data?\": \"Transport and traffic services do not necessarily need personal data. Data can be anonymised and aggregated, which also provides greater reliability and better quality services. Where personal data is necessary, this data is subject to the EU data protection rules, notably GDPR. This is also, in particular, a crucial concern when it comes to access to in-vehicle data.\", \"What are you doing to improve ticketing, notably when it comes to rail and multimodality?\": \"In 2022, the Commission will present a new initiative on multimodal digital mobility services. This initiative aims at supporting the development of digital service intermediaries, which can help passengers identify all the tickets available and easily book (even if the journey has different legs and/or is operated by different operators). This proposal will also look at journey continuation agreements in the rail sector, with the objective of opening them up to all operators and making them more transparent. In addition, the Commission is in parallel looking to revise the existing Delegated Regulation on multimodal travel information services to further support journey-planning services.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6725\": {\"What is the purpose of TEN-T policy?\": \"The EU's Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) policy aims at building an effective, EU-wide and multimodal transport network across the EU. It comprises railways, inland waterways, short sea shipping routes and roads linked to cities, maritime and inland ports, airports and terminals. TEN-T policy does so by identifying the transport infrastructure in Member States that has high added value at the European level and that should be part of the TEN-T network. TEN-T policy also sets requirements that this infrastructure must comply with, including on safety, quality for highly performing transport and alignment with environmental objectives. The policy is a key instrument for the development of coherent, connected and high-quality transport infrastructure across the EU. It incentivises the sustainable and more efficient transportation of people and goods, ensures access to jobs and services, and enables trade and economic growth. It also strengthens the EU's economic, social and territorial cohesion by creating seamless transport systems across borders, without missing links and bottlenecks.\", \"Why is the TEN-T Regulation being revised?\": \"Revising the TEN-T Regulation offers a real opportunity to make our Trans-European Transport Network fit for the future, and to align the development of  the TEN-T network to the  European Green Deal objectives and the climate targets of the EU Climate Law. Cutting greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector by 90%, compared with 1990 levels, by 2050, is key to achieving climate-neutrality by the same date. To make such significant emission cuts, we need a modern, fully-fledged European transport network (1) that makes all transport modes more sustainable by setting firm incentives and requirements for transport infrastructure development and by better integrating the different modes in a multimodal transport system, (2) that ensures that new infrastructure projects on the network are climate-proof and consistent with environmental objectives and (3) that delivers the infrastructure basis for alternative fuel deployment. At the same time, the TEN-T revision will reinforce the governance and monitoring instruments in place to ensure on-time network completion and exploit synergies between infrastructure planning and transport operations. This includes binding work plans to remove further obstacles for quicker and more efficient rail freight and passenger services.\", \"What are the key elements of the revised TEN-T Regulation?\": \"The TEN-T Regulation supports the development of a reliable and seamless trans-European transport network that offers sustainable connectivity throughout the European Union, without physical gaps, bottlenecks or missing links. This high-quality network shall be gradually completed in three steps: 2030 for the core network, 2040 for the extended core network and 2050 for the comprehensive network. The core and extended core network together form the European Transport Corridors which are the most strategic part of the network with highest EU added value. The main novelties compared to the 2013 Regulation: High infrastructure standards for all modes applied throughout the entire network.Nine \\u2018European Transport Corridors', representing the main arteries of EU transport, that integrate the former Core Network Corridors with the Rail Freight Corridors.Stronger synergies between infrastructure planning and the operation of transport services. Examples include higher speeds for train services across the TEN-T network (160 kilometres per hour for passenger services and 100 kilometres per hour for freight), maximum waiting times at borders of 15 minutes for rail freight. Another example is guaranteed good navigation status per river basin on the inland waterways on the TEN-T network.Requirements for the deployment, across the TEN-T network, of the charging and refuelling infrastructure needed for alternative transport fuels in line with the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation. This would mean sufficient charging capacity for cars, vans and trucks at 60 kilometres distance in each direction by 2025 on the core network and by 2030 for the extended core and comprehensive networks.Providing safe and secure parking areas for commercial drivers, equipped with alternative fuels infrastructure.Use of innovative technologies like 5G to further advance the digitalisation of transport infrastructure, further increasing efficiency, and improving the safety, security and resilience of the network.Increased resilience of the TEN-T network to natural and human-made disasters via climate-proofing requirements and environmental impact assessments for new projects, and to the implications of an accident or breakdown (e.g. by enabling alternative route alignments to the main network).The requirement for 424 major cities (\\u201ccities\\u201d) on the TEN-T network to have sustainable urban mobility plans by 2025, in order to align their mobility developments on the TEN-T network. The SUMPs will contain measures such as the promotion of zero-emission mobility and the greening of the urban fleet.More transhipment hubs and multimodal passenger terminals in cities to facilitate multimodality, in particular for the last mile of a passenger or freight journey.Connect large airports to rail, where possible high-speed rail.Making it possible network-wide for lorries to be transported by trains.\", \"What are the milestones for the completion of the TEN-T network?\": \"The TEN-T network will be completed in three steps: By 2030 \\u2013 completion of the core TEN-T network at existing TEN-T standards such as the electrification of the entire rail network and the possibility to run 740 m trains. By 2040 \\u2013 completion of the extended core network according to the new standards such as the 160 km/h minimum line speed for passenger rail.* The new standards proposed in the revision, in particular on green transport and enhanced digitalisation, will apply by this date for both the core and extended core network. ERTMS shall also be deployed by 2040 on the entire TEN-T network and national systems being removed. The 2040 milestone has been added to accelerate network completion in view of reaching the EUs climate ambitions by 2050. By 2050 \\u2013 completion of the entire Trans-European Transport Network, including the sections within the comprehensive network.\", \"How and on what basis have the TEN-T maps been redesigned?\": \"The design of the TEN-T is based on the objective and transparent planning methodology that was established in 2013. It has now been updated in the framework of TEN-T Regulation revision. The methodology comprises a number of criteria. In a first step, the comprehensive network is identified. In a second step, parts of the comprehensive network are identified as representing the trans-European transport network's strategically most important links and hence as  part of the core network to be completed by 2030 or the extended core network to be completed by 2040. Only very limited changes are proposed to the core network. The current core network should remain stable in view of its completion in less than 10 years.\", \"What are the expected economic and climate benefits of the TEN-T completion?\": \"The revision of the TEN-T Regulation will offer significant economic benefits, as outlined by the impact assessment. Taking all of the new measures into account, we can expect a GDP increase of 2.4% by 2050, relative to the current situation. This translates into a \\u20ac467 billion increase of GDP in 2050. The numerous projects that must be implemented to complete the TEN-T will also create new jobs. The higher investment stimulated by the revised TEN-T is expected to increase employment by around 0.5% by 2050 \\u2013 that is an additional 840 000 jobs by 2050. The revised TEN-T Regulation is expected to reduce overall CO2 emissions: by 0.3% by 2050 along the comprehensive network, and by 0.4% along the core network by 2050. The reduction in the external costs caused by CO2 emissions is estimated at around \\u20ac387 million over the 2021-2050 period, while that of air pollution is estimated at around \\u20ac420 million. This is achieved mainly via the predicted shift towards sustainable transport modes such as rail and inland waterways. This will complement the greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution reductions resulting from earlier proposals such as the CO2 performance standards for cars and vans, and the roll-out of the necessary charging points and alternative refuelling points as foreseen under the proposed Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation. New quality standards and safety features will also improve road safety, reducing the number of fatalities and injuries sustained on EU roads. The external costs caused by accidents are expected to fall by around \\u20ac3 930 million over the 2021-2050 period. For inter-urban road congestion, costs are expected to fall by around \\u20ac2 891 million during the same period.\", \"What is the link between the TEN-T revision and the revision of the ITS Directive?\": \"The ITS Directive regulates the provision of intelligent transport systems on the TEN-T network. The ITS Directive \\u2013 and the AFIR Regulation \\u2013 rely on the TEN-T Regulation for the geographical scope of the deployment of alternative fuel infrastructure and intelligent transport systems. The geographical scope can be found in the maps contained in the TEN-T Regulation.\", \"What is the link between the TEN-T revision and the Action Plan on Rail?\": \"The Commission is today also presenting an Action Plan on Rail to boost long-distance and cross-border passenger rail services. Infrastructure plays an important role in this plan. In particular, the TEN-T revision will ensure sufficient high-speed capacity and connections. It proposes, amongst other measures, a minimum speed of 160 km/h for the core and extended core network, as well as increased efforts to better connect airports by railways.\", \"What is the link between the TEN-T revision and the EU Urban Mobility framework?\": \"Cities are important points of transfer and last-mile connection within or between different transport modes on the TEN-T. It is important to ensure that neither capacity bottlenecks nor insufficient network connectivity within urban nodes can hamper multimodality along the trans-European transport network. For this reason, the new provisions introduced through the revised TEN-T Regulation require that by 2040, at least one multimodal passenger hub and one multimodal freight terminal allowing for sufficient transhipment capacity within or in the vicinity of the urban node is in place. In addition, by 2025, the 424 cities identified in the new TEN-T regulation must develop a Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMP) that includes measures to integrate the different modes of transport, and to promote zero-emission mobility.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6823\": {\"What is the proposal for a Council Recommendation on ensuring a fair transition towards climate neutrality about?\": \"The European Green Deal puts social fairness at its heart, leaving no person and no place behind during the EU's transition to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Today's proposal for a Council Recommendation on a fair transition towards climate neutrality was announced in July 2021 as part of the Commission's \\u2018Fit for 55' package to provide further guidance to Member States on how to best address the social and labour aspects of the green transition. While Member States have already put in place and are preparing further actions to promote a fair transition towards climate neutrality, there is scope to further enhance the design of policies in a comprehensive and cross-cutting manner and ensure coherence of the spending efforts at EU and national level. The proposed Council Recommendation offers concrete guidance to Member States on how to put the right policies and actions in place and how to make full use of the funding options available to achieve a fair and inclusive transition. The Commission proposes measures that provide targeted support to people, households, sectors and regions that are most affected. A common framework and shared understanding of the policies and investments needed for sharing fairly the costs and benefits of the transition is also included. This will help realise the employment and social potential the green transition offers, including the creation of quality jobs, and will help prevent and address social inequalities and challenges.\", \"Why is this Recommendation needed?\": \"The green transition will bring changes to the way we live, move and work. We need well-designed policies to fully realise its employment and social potential. A fair transition towards climate neutrality in the Union by 2050 will ensure that no one is left behind, in particular people and households most dependent on fossil fuels and most affected by the green transition, and notably those already in vulnerable situations. With the right policies in place, the green transition could create 1 million additional quality jobs in the EU by 2030, and some 2 million by 2050. New job opportunities are expected in sectors such as construction, sustainable transport, renewable energy production or the circular economy (including repair and re-use business models). The green transition can help tackle pre-existing socio-economic inequalities and social exclusion, improving health and wellbeing, and promoting equality. The cost of non-action on climate and environmental policy would be immense for people, in particular those in vulnerable situations, in terms of living standards, health and wellbeing. However, the transition can also give rise to substantial social challenges for certain population groups, notably for those already in or on the verge of being in vulnerable situations. This includes low- and lower-middle income households, who spend a high share of their income on essential services such as energy, transport and housing, as well as micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. The proposed Council Recommendation also encourages Member States to support people who will transition into new jobs and will need to adapt their skill-set through training. It is therefore essential to fully use all available instruments and put in place the right policies at EU, national, regional and local levels. Support to live, move and consume sustainably offers \\u2018win-win' solutions by tackling pre-existing inequalities and contributing to greening our economies and societies at the same time.\", \"What policies and actions does the Recommendation propose?\": \"Member States are encouraged to adopt comprehensive policy packages for a fair transition towards climate neutrality. To prepare these packages, the Commission recommends an inclusive approach that actively involves social partners, civil society, regional and local authorities, and other stakeholders and is informed by the best available data and evidence. Member States are also encouraged to make optimal use of private and public funding at EU and national level. In particular, Member States are encouraged to act in four policy areas: Active support to quality employment: This includes tailored job search assistance, flexible learning courses for green and digital skills and employment programmes for people in vulnerable situations. Member States are invited to also make use of hiring and transition incentives to accompany labour market transitions, and promote job creation and entrepreneurship. The latter should combine financial measures with advisory services and be designed in a way that is also accessible for disadvantaged groups. Equal access to quality and inclusive education, training and lifelong learning: This includes developing up-to-date information about skills needs in the labour market and strengthening support for apprenticeships in sectors facing skills shortages. Providing high-quality and inclusive education and training that equips learners with skills and competences relevant for the green transition is also one of the proposed recommendations. Under the Pact for Skills, so far, 450 organisations have pledged to provide the right skills for 1.5 million people. Skills partnerships by industrial, social, regional and education partners have emerged, for instance in the area of offshore renewable energy. Member States should continue to set up such stakeholder partnerships. Fair tax-benefit and social protection systems: The Recommendation invites Member States to put forward policies to ensure the continued fairness of tax-benefit systems and social protection systems in the context of the green transition. This should support the people and households most affected by the green transition, notably those in vulnerable situations. For instance, Member States are encouraged to shift the tax burden away from labour and reducing the tax wedge for low and middle-income groups towards other sources contributing to climate and environmental objectives. Access to affordable essential services and housing: This includes mobilising public and private financial support for renewable energy sources and energy efficiency. Member States are encouraged to ensure these actions go hand-in-hand with advice to consumers to better manage their energy use and to take informed decisions on saving energy, with a particular focus on vulnerable households and communities. Investments in renovating buildings, including in social housing, need to be prioritised. Measures to prevent and tackle mobility challenges for households in vulnerable situations, especially in remote, rural and low-income regions and cities are also encouraged, also including by developing the necessary infrastructure.\", \"How does the new Recommendation build on existing EU initiatives?\": \"Social fairness is at the heart of the European Green Deal, including the \\u2018Fit for 55' policy package. The proposed Recommendation complements the July 2021 Commission's proposal to establish a Social Climate Fund. The Recommendation builds on, integrates and complements previous EU guidance to Member States, including the Commission Recommendation on Effective Active Support to Employment (EASE) and the 2022 Employment Guidelines, and existing EU funding and investment instruments.\", \"What EU funding is available to support a fair transition?\": \"There is a broad range of EU funds available to support the actions we recommend in this proposal. The Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) ensures that at least 37% of the funding available under the RRF is dedicated to green and climate policies. So far, Member States have allocated almost 40% of the spending in their recovery and resilience plans to green measures, exceeding this target. The RRF also provides additional funding for social investments to support reskilling and upskilling and promotes critical structural reforms to enable the green transition.The proposal for a Social Climate Fund, arising from the revenues of a new emission trading system for buildings and road transport, would mobilise \\u20ac72.2 billion to address the impacts of emissions trading in road transport and buildings on vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users. The Social Climate Fund can finance temporary direct income support for vulnerable households and help citizens to finance investments in energy efficiency, new heating and cooling systems, and cleaner mobility.The Just Transition Mechanism, including the Just Transition Fund, provides targeted support to alleviate the socio-economic impact of the green transition in the most affected regions.The European Social Fund Plus is the EU's main instrument for investing in people, including in the area of green skills development, green entrepreneurship, search assistance for green jobs, job creation in green sectors, social inclusion of people impacted by the transition, and occupational safety and health. Other funds which support employment, social and climate policies include the European Regional Development Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe (REACT-EU), InvestEU, ERASMUS+, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Displaced Workers, the LIFE programme, the Horizon Europe programme, the Modernisation Fund, and the funds under the Common Agriculture Policy.\", \"What are the next steps?\": \"The Commission proposal will now be discussed by Member States. Once adopted, Member States are invited to implement the recommended actions and policies. The Commission will monitor the implementation of the Council Recommendation in the context of the European Semester, the framework for coordinating economic and social policies across the EU. The proposed Recommendation also outlines next steps for the Commission. These include more and deeper exchanges with key stakeholders, people and communities concerned, with a focus on the most affected sectors and regions. The Commission will also further support data gathering, analysis and foresight of fair green transition challenges and policies, such as energy and transport poverty and access to essential services.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6822\": {\"Why is the revision of the Schengen Borders Code needed?\": \"The recent Strategy on the future of Schengen acknowledged that improvements are needed to ensure that the Schengen area can tackle current and evolving challenges such as a public health threat or instrumentalisation of people. The proposed revision of the Schengen Borders Code offers solutions so that any reintroduction of internal border controls remains a measure of last resort. The revision also incorporates lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic by proposing improved EU coordination for situations of serious threats to public health affecting one or more Member States. It proposes a legal basis for restrictions on non-essential travel to the European Union in epidemic situations, as well as increased EU coordination for crises, including those of serious threats to public health affecting several Member States at the same time.\", \"What are the current rules concerning the reintroduction of controls at internal borders?\": \"The current Schengen Borders Code gives Member States the possibility to temporarily reintroduce border control at internal borders where there is a serious threat to public policy or internal security. The reintroduction of border control at internal borders should remain exceptional and proportional. Border controls should be lifted once the reasons no longer apply. Currently, the Schengen Borders Code includes 2 procedures: Article 28: Member States can reintroduce internal border controls in cases requiring immediate action (unforeseen circumstances), for a limited period of up to 10 days, with a possibility of renewal of up to 20 days, for the maximum period of 2 months in total. Member States will continue to be able to unilaterally reintroduce internal border controls in case of a threat to public policy or internal security.Article 25: the Member States may reintroduce border controls in foreseeable circumstances, and for an initial period of 30 days, renewable up to a maximum of six months.\", \"What changes are proposed to the rules on reintroduction of internal border checks?\": \"Proposed changes include notably: Unforeseen events: For unforeseen threats, Member States can unilaterally introduce controls for 30 days, extendable up to 3 months.Foreseeable events: In case border control needs to be reintroduced for foreseeable events, they can do so for renewable periods of up to 6 months. The maximum duration of border control at internal borders should not exceed 2 years. However, in exceptional situations Member States may decide that border controls need to be maintained longer.More detailed notifications: Whenever introducing controls, Member States should justify their proportionality and necessity, taking into account the impact on the right to free movement and on cross-border regions.More safeguards: In case border controls have been in place for 6 months, any further notification for the prolongation of such controls needs to be accompanied by a risk assessment in addition. If border controls have been in place for 18 months, the Commission would be required to issue an opinion on necessity and proportionality of such internal border controls.Mitigating measures: An obligation for Member States to define appropriate mitigating measures to minimise the impact of reintroduction of border controls.Possibility for a coordinated European response: The Commission may propose to the Council to adopt an implementing decision authorising the reintroduction of border controls by Member States where other measures are not sufficient to address a serious threat. Where the Commission does not find such controls proportionate to the threat, it can recommend the use of alternative measures.\", \"What lessons does the proposal draw from the pandemic?\": \"The COVID-19 pandemic placed a major strain on the Schengen area, with as many as 17 Member States unilaterally reintroducing internal border controls, at times jeopardising the proper functioning of the internal market, disrupting the movement of people within the EU and negatively impacting those living and working in border regions and the supply chains. Several innovations are proposed based on lessons learned from the pandemic. These include: obligatory mitigating measures during reintroduced border controls, based on the experience of the \\u2018green lanes';a new coordinated procedure to introduce restrictions on travel to the EU, if required;a new procedure to introduce internal border checks in a coordinated way in case of a threat affecting several Member States at the same time.\", \"How would the coordinated procedure to introduce travel restrictions work?\": \"Building on the experience of the pandemic, the proposal would establish a new mechanism to allow for a timely adoption, by the Council, of a binding instrument setting out temporary travel restrictions at the external borders if required for public health reasons. Thanks to this mechanism, travel restrictions will apply uniformly in all Member States for as long as the threat to public health persists in the Union. When the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control detects the existence of an infectious disease with epidemic potential outside the EU, the Commission may propose to the Council to adopt an implementing regulation providing for temporary travel restrictions. Such a legal instrument should specify any categories of persons exempted from travel restrictions, even in situations where they travel for non-essential reasons, and/or, on the basis of objective indicators, any geographical areas or third countries from which travel may be subject to specific measures. It would also define any additional conditions to be imposed on travellers to make travel safe. In line with obligations under Union and international law, Union citizens and other people who enjoy rights of free movement within the EU, and their respective family members, should always be permitted to enter the Union. Residents should also always be permitted to return to the Union. Moreover, the instrument should define a minimum list of categories of travelers that are considered necessary in connection with essential functions or needs and should therefore not be covered by the travel restriction. The instrument could also set up an \\u2018emergency brake' mechanism, allowing the Union to take relevant measures in case the epidemiological situation dramatically worsens in one or more geographical areas.\", \"How will the new rules ensure that the reintroduction of controls at internal borders remains a measure of last resort? Will the new rules limit the possibility of reintroducing internal border controls?\": \"The proposal seeks to draw lessons from the reasons why and ways in which several Member States have reintroduced internal border controls in response to events in recent years. In order to address these challenges, the proposal includes: on the one hand, more safeguards accompanying the reintroduction of border controls (such as a compulsory risk assessment) and tools to help the Commission assess their necessity and proportionality (such as regular reporting obligations for the Member States);and on the other hand, more possibilities for the use of alternative measures such as police or other checks within the territory, particularly to address unauthorised movements within the Schengen area, including a possibility for Member States to transfer back those not entitled to enter their territory during joint police patrols.\", \"What is the new Schengen safeguard mechanism?\": \"The proposed Schegen safeguard mechanism aims to address situations where there is a serious threat to public policy or internal security that puts at risk the overall functioning of the area without internal border controls as it affects a majority of Member States at the same time. This mechansim empowers the Council, based on a proposal from the Commission, to adopt an implementing decision authorising the reintroduction of controls by Member States in a coordinated way, which would replace any national measures in place. This decision will also define national and European measures to mitigate the impact of border controls. The decision would cover a maximum period  6 months, which may be renewed, upon proposal from the Commission, for further periods of up to 6 months as long as the threat persists. The Commission will regularly review the evolution of the identified threat as well as the impact of the measures adopted, to assess whether the measures remain justified.\", \"What constitutes a situation of instrumentalisation of irregular migration? What would be the possible EU response?\": \"Instrumentalisation of migrants is when a third country instigates irregular migratory flows into the EU by actively encouraging or facilitating the movement of people from outside the EU to the external borders. The clear intention of the third country is to destabilise  the Union or a Member State, where the nature of such actions is liable to put at risk essential State functions, including its territorial integrity, the maintenance of law and order or the safeguard of its national security. Under the proposal, the Member State facing a situation of instrumentalisation of people has the possibility to immediately restrict border crossing points and increase border surveillance and can also request specific asylum measures. To trigger this mechanism, the Member State affected should send a request to the Commission requesting support and solidarity measures from other Member States. The Commission may follow up with a proposal for the Council to authorise the application of the derogations set out in this proposal. The triggering of the mechanism should take into account whether the European Council has concluded that the Union is facing a situation of instrumentalisation of people in one or more of its Member States. The measures include support from other Member States, through capacity building; support for return through cooperation with third countries; and outreach to third countries whose nationals are being instrumentalised. They also include procedural and other derogations for the Member State facing a situation of instrumentalisation, in order to help with effective border and migration management in such an exceptional situation. These include: Extending the deadline for registration of applications for international protection and the extension of the duration of the border procedure;Introducing an emergency migration and asylum management procedure, which allows Member States to apply the asylum border procedure to decide on all applications, except for medical cases. The maximum duration of the emergency asylum management procedure is 16 weeks;Providing a possibility to set different material receptions conditions for applicants while ensuring access to health care and the full respect of human dignity;Introducing a possibility to derogate from the application of the proposal for a Return Directive recast in relation to people whose application for international protection was rejected on the basis of the emergency asylum management procedure.\", \"Would these measures affect fundamental rights?\": \"The proposed measures safeguard fundamental rights by ensuring that all arrivals at the EU's external border in the Member State faced with instrumentalisation have a genuine and effective access to the asylum procedure. The principles and guarantees provided by EU asylum law as proposed under the New Pact on Migration Asylum (Asylum Procedures Regulation, amended Reception Conditions Directive and amended Return Directive) remain applicable to applicants subject to the procedures under the proposal. In line with those rules, asylum seekers will have access to legal assistance, the right to an effective remedy, in the form of an appeal or a review, in fact and in law, before a court or tribunal, and detention cannot be applied systematically but only as a measure of last resort. The proposal guarantees the right to an effective remedy ensuring that Courts have power to rule whether or not the applicant may remain on the territory of the Member State pending a decision on an appeal and with the right guarantees applicable to enable an applicant to make such requests to the Courts. The guarantees for persons with special procedural needs under the amended Asylum Procedure Regulation also continue to apply.\", \"How is the proposal to address situations of instrumentalisation in the field of migration and asylum different from the measures proposed on 1 December under article 78.3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union?\": \"Today's proposal builds on the Commission proposal for temporary measures to manage the situation at the external border with Belarus. This proposal creates a permanent tool that could be activated rapidly in case of need. In addition to providing an effective response, it also aims to be a preventive measure by demonstrating the EU's readiness to act rapidly.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6701\": {\"What actions is the Commission planning to boost passenger rail?\": \"This Action Plan complements the Commission's Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy, which sets ambitious milestones for rail transport. It builds on the experiences and findings of the 2021 European Year of Rail. It focuses on two main pillars: The full and correct implementation of the existing EU regulatory framework for railways, including the removal of any redundant national rules.The removal of obstacles to long-distance and cross-border passenger rail services. The Action Plan is a roadmap for the coming years with the goal to make long-distance cross-border rail travel more attractive for many more European passengers, notably by making rail journeys quicker, more frequent and more affordable. This action plan announces a multimodal legislative proposal in 2022 to improve among other things ticketing for long distance, cross-border train travel in Europe. Planning and booking cross-border train trips must become easier and more user-friendly, enabling passengers to quickly find the best available ticket at the best price, with better protection when a journey is disrupted. This initiative aims to improve data exchange between mobility providers and facilitate the conclusion of commercial agreements between railway undertakings and third-party ticket sellers, in this way boosting the availability of train tickets. This would also make it possible for passengers to buy a ticket for journeys that combine train travel with local public transport and other mobility options. Lastly, the Action Plan also contains measures to improve the functioning of the rail network in a way that would make rail travel more affordable. The Commission will explore the possibilities for a European Union-wide VAT exemption for international train journeys. In 2023, the Commission will issue guidelines on the setting of track access charges that boost affordable cross-border train travel. High and diverse charges can hinder the setting up of new services, making the market less attractive for new players,  resulting in less competition which is likely to have a negative effect on ticket prices. To empower in particular young people to choose rail or other sustainable modes of transport, the Action Plan proposes amending the current Erasmus reimbursement rules to promote the use of rail travel to Erasmus exchange locations. Along with the Action Plan, the Commission is today presenting a proposal to revise the Trans-European transport network (TEN-T) Regulation, to ensure sufficient high-speed capacity and connections. It proposes, amongst other measures, a minimum speed of 160 km/h for the core network, as well as increased efforts to better connect airports to railways. From 2022, the rail sector will be encouraged to submit proposals for cross-border pilot services. The Commission aims to support 15 cross-border pilot services as an opportunity to test some of the measures identified in the Action Plan.\", \"Why is the Commission adopting the Action Plan now?\": \"During the COP26 in Glasgow last month, the world agreed that we must accelerate efforts to stay within reach of the +1.5 degree scenario for global warming. Rail is part of the solution, being responsible for less than 0.4% of transport-related greenhouse gas emissions in the EU. This makes it one of the most sustainable forms of passenger and freight transport and key to the EU's ambition of becoming climate-neutral by 2050. Among other benefits, rail is exceptionally safe and it connects people and businesses across the EU via the Trans-European Transport network (TEN-T). Against this backdrop, the Commission announced this Action Plan to boost long-distance and cross-border passenger rail services in its Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy of December 2020. To achieve the ambitious milestones for rail transport contained therein, the Action Plan is aimed at making the best use of the Single European Railway Area to boost competition and innovative, affordable train services and to present a programme to remove the main obstacles that still obstruct the set-up and operation of long-distance cross-border passenger rail services.\", \"How can Member States help implement the Action Plan?\": \"Member States can first and foremost ensure the full and correct implementation of the existing EU regulatory framework for railways, including the removal of any redundant national rules. Here, Member States need to fully and correctly transpose and implement EU legislation, and make sure that redundant national rules are abolished. Furthermore, EU legislation for rail gives Member States ample opportunity to act on key issues such as track access charges, data sharing and ticket re-sell licensing requirements in Public Service Contracts and other legally binding acts, discrimination-free State aid schemes to incentivise the availability of rolling stock and the coordination of cross-border train paths between infrastructure managers.\", \"How can the rail sector help implement the Action Plan?\": \"Stakeholders such as railway undertakings, infrastructure managers, regulatory bodies and third party ticket vendors have a key role to play in correctly applying EU legislation for rail, such as the Fourth Railway Package. With the 15 pilot services foreseen, the Commission intends to offer stakeholders an opportunity to test measures in the Action Plan in the very short term. Experience and recent announcements by railway undertakings show that long-distance and high-speed services can often be operated profitably as open access services, including night trains. Increased market opening, harmonisation of rules and ticketing solutions for passengers make it easier for railway undertakings to offer profitable rail services. Therefore, the Commission is confident that implementation of the actions contained in this Action Plan is in the direct interest of railway undertakings, irrespective their ownership structure.\", \"What about night train services, does the Commission plan specific actions for them?\": \"This Action Plan aims at boosting long-distance and cross border rail services. As night train services travel long distances and often cross borders, they will benefit in full from the measures foreseen in this Action Plan. The rules on public service obligations set out in Regulation 1370/2007 are relevant for these services as well. In 2022, the Commission will adopt updated Interpretative Guidelines on Regulation 1370/2007 that will include cross-border services.\", \"How do you propose to improve air-to-rail services?\": \"The Commission is proposing a revision of the trans-European transport network (TEN-T) Regulation, which will improve the passenger rail network and ensure its better integration within the multimodal transport system. The proposed revised Regulation will ensure strengthening of air-rail connectivity for all core EU airports and EU airports above 4 million passengers. Further, the Commission will support and promote air-rail multimodal journeys on routes where the suitable infrastructure is in place to deliver such services, and assess regulatory options to facilitate such multimodal services.\", \"Can Member States support cross-border services under public contracts?\": \"When there is demand for cross-border services and the market cannot deliver the desired level, indeed it is possible for Member States to procure services, in compliance with Regulation (EU) 1370/2007 ('Land PSO Regulation'). This Regulation also applies to cross-border services, including local, regional and long-distance. For a cross-border PSO to be established, the Member States on whose territory the services are provided must formally agree to it. This agreement does not mean that the Member State in question is required to specify public service obligations on its territory or provide financing. Compliance with the Regulation ensures that PSO services cannot be used to restrict competition. If one or more Member States does not agree with a PSO approach on their territory, cross-border services can also run \\u2018hybrid' services, i.e. cross-border services combining one or more legs operated under PSOs with one or more legs operated under an open access regime (where a Member State does not agree to a PSO). In the absence of specific EU rules for such hybrid services, particular care should be taken by competent national, regional or local authorities to avoid distortions of competition and the risk of cross-subsidies.\", \"What are the next steps?\": \"Most of the actions included in the Action Plan should be implemented as a matter of urgency. The Commission plans to launch a dialogue with rail sector stakeholders with a view to facilitate the setting up of cross-border pilot services. These will be an opportunity to test some of the measures identified in this Action Plan. Pilot- services could improve on existing train services or be completely new services. The Commission will support the projects by facilitating contact between all relevant stakeholders and by providing assistance to help ensure compliance with EU law and EU policies. The Commission will also assist in the identification of financing opportunities for particular pilots, as highlighted in this Action Plan. Although many of the train services will be viable commercially, the Connecting Europe Facility can finance technical assistance, and support studies and preparatory activities relating to new technologies and innovation. Pilot projects must comply with applicable European legislation, for example on a level playing field in the Single Market and passenger rights. Amongst the measures announced in the Action Plan are the following legislative proposals and guidelines: revision of the trans-European transport network (TEN-T) Regulation, which will improve the passenger rail network and ensure it is better integrated within the multimodal transport system;revision of the Technical Specifications for Interoperability, including for \\u201cgo-everywhere\\u201d passenger rolling stock (2022);a revised regulatory framework for train drivers (2022).regulatory action to improve capacity allocation and traffic management processes (2022)guidelines for setting track access charges which support long-distance and cross-border passenger services (2023);a new regulation on multimodal digital mobility services that covers rail ticketing (2022);assessment of the need for an EU-wide VAT exemption for international train servicesinterpretative guidelines for applying the Land PSO Regulation (2022)a proposal to amend Erasmus reimbursement rules to promote the use of sustainable modes of transport.\", \"The Action Plan mentions a \\u201cGreen Rail Investment Platform\\u201d by the European Investment Bank. What does it entail?\": \"The setting up of new rail services requires large investment in rolling stock, either by railway undertakings, by rolling stock leasing companies or by competent authorities. To boost the availability of rolling stock, the European Investment Bank (EIB) is now launching the Green Rail Investment Platform (GRIP) to assist investments, by both public and private entities in rail projects, through existing EIB products and through financial instruments made available by the Commission. The objective of the GRIP is to support sustainable rail investment in infrastructure, rolling stock and digital systems, in particular in: the development of the rail network, its renewal and upgrade;acquisition and retrofit of rolling stock, including under Public Service Obligations, but also for commercial rail services, night trains and freight services by rolling stock operators and rolling stock leasing companies;development of intermodal transport, including terminals, rolling stock and cross-border facilities;the digitalisation and automation of core planning, operational and commercial processes, such as the asset, capacity and traffic management, of infrastructure managers, railway undertakings and other relevant stakeholders such as terminal and intermodal operators, to improve the efficiency of multimodal logistics chains involving rail. Under certain conditions, rolling stock can also be financed under the Union's Cohesion Policy Funds. The Commission will also clarify by 2023 the State aid rules on public funding of interoperable rolling stock for cross-border services in the revised Railway Guidelines.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6773\": {\"What is Health Technology Assessment (HTA)?\": \"Health Technology Assessment (HTA) summarises information about medical, economic, social and ethical issues related to the use of a health technology. Examples of health technologies include medicinal products, medical equipment and diagnostics. HTA answers clinical questions like: \\u201cHow well does the new technology work compared with existing alternative health technologies\\u201d? It can also answer economic questions like \\u201cWhat costs are entailed for the health system\\u201d? HTA is therefore a key tool for Member States to ensure the quality, accessibility and sustainability of healthcare.\", \"What does the new HTA Regulation cover?\": \"The HTA Regulation focuses on clinical aspects of HTA, i.e. the relative clinical effectiveness and relative clinical safety of a new health technology as compared with existing technologies. Member States' HTA bodies will conduct Joint Clinical Assessments of new medicines and certain high-risk medical devices. They will also engage in Joint Scientific Consultations to advise technology developers on clinical study designs that generate appropriate evidence. Moreover, \\u201chorizon scanning\\u201d exercises will identify, at an early stage, promising health technologies, to help health systems prepare for them. In addition to this mandatory scope of the HTA Regulation, Member States may also engage in further voluntary cooperation, e.g. on health technologies other than medicines and medical devices, or on economic aspects of HTA.\", \"Who will benefit from the new rules?\": \"Patients and clinicians will benefit from Joint Clinical Assessment reports that are of high scientific quality, transparent and accessible to the public. Health experts, the producers, and most importantly of all \\u2013 patients, will have a new framework that will help address unmet medical needs and facilitate access to innovative medicines and some high-risk medical devices. Member States will be able to pool their HTA resources and expertise. Joint Clinical Assessments will be high quality, timely scientific reports that Member States will give due consideration to in their national HTA processes. The HTA Regulation will therefore support Member States in taking more evidence-based and timely decisions on patient access to new medicines and medical devices. Developers in the pharmaceutical and medical device sectors will have more clarity and predictability concerning the clinical evidence requirements for HTA. Developers will also benefit from efficiency gains when submitting clinical evidence for HTA, as there will be only a single EU-level submission file for Joint Clinical Assessments (rather than, as in the past, multiple parallel submissions to the different national HTA systems).\", \"How will Member States use Joint Clinical Assessment reports?\": \"Article 13 of the HTA Regulation stipulates that Member States will give due consideration to the Joint Clinical Assessment report when carrying out a national HTA on the health technology concerned. They will also annex the published Joint Clinical Assessment report to the HTA report at Member State level. In addition, for each national HTA on a technology which has been subject to Joint Clinical Assessment, Member States will provide information on how the Joint Clinical Assessment has been considered in the national process. Member States may complement the Joint Clinical Assessment with additional clinical analyses that may be needed in their national HTA process (e.g. analyses related to national disease epidemiology or the specific national healthcare context). Member States may also complement the Joint Clinical Assessment with non-clinical analyses (e.g. on budget impact or cost-effectiveness). Finally, Member States remain responsible for drawing conclusions on the overall value of a new health technology for their healthcare system, and pricing and reimbursement decisions. Finally, Member States will report to the Commission, no later than two years after the date of application of the new HTA Regulation, on the consideration of joint work in their national HTA processes, including the way joint clinical assessment reports have been considered when carrying out national HTAs. Member States will also report on the workload of the Coordination Group and on whether they have considered the developed methodological guidance.\", \"How will the new framework of EU HTA cooperation work in practice?\": \"The Regulation establishes a Member State Coordination Group of members designated by each country. The Coordination Group will oversee the joint technical work carried out by subgroups of national representatives for specific types of work (e.g. Joint Clinical Assessments, Joint Scientific Consultations, or methodological guidance documents). External experts, including clinicians and patients, will also be able to provide input during the preparation of joint work (Joint Clinical Assessment and Joint Scientific Consultation). On the other hand, stakeholder organisations, including patient organisations, healthcare professional organisations, clinical and learned societies, as well as health technology developers and payers will be able to provide input on non-product related matters, such as on the drafting and preparation of methodological guidance documents. A Stakeholder Network will be set up to facilitate a regular dialogue between European umbrella stakeholder organisations and the Coordination Group. The Commission will serve as secretariat to the cooperation, ensuring that procedures are followed and joint work is produced in a timely and transparent manner. The Commission will also facilitate exchange of information with other relevant EU agencies and bodies (e.g. the European Medicines Agency).\", \"What are the next steps in implementing the HTA Regulation?\": \"The HTA Regulation will enter into force in January 2022 and it will be applied three years later (January 2025). This means that joint work such as Joint Clinical Assessments and Joint Scientific Consultations will only be carried out from January 2025. The three year delayed application period aims to ensure that there is enough time to set up the organisational framework of the HTA Regulation (e.g. the Coordination Group and its subgroups, the Stakeholder Network) and to adopt the implementing and delegated acts and methodological guidance documents provided for by the Regulation. The delayed application will also give Member States time to adjust their national HTA legislation and processes to the new HTA Regulation as needed, and stakeholder organisations, in particular health technology developers, will have time to familiarise and comply with the requirements of the new framework. As a first implementation step following entry into force in January 2022, the Commission will set up the Coordination Group composed of representatives designated by Member States. The first meeting of the Coordination Group is tentatively planned in June 2022. Around the same time, a conference is envisaged to inform a wide range of stakeholder organisations on the new Regulation and its implementation. The Commission will also launch the procedure to set up the Stakeholder Network provided for by the Regulation.\", \"Who will implement the HTA Regulation?\": \"The HTA Regulation grants implementing powers to the Commission and confers to it powers to adopt delegated acts. When defining the measures contained in the implementing acts, the Commission will be assisted by a committee composed of representatives from all EU countries (comitology procedure).* On the other hand, in order to prepare and adopt delegated acts, the Commission will have to consult expert groups. Citizens and other stakeholders can provide feedback on the draft text of a delegated act during the publication for feedback according to the Commission's better regulation agenda.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6477\": {\"What are individual learning accounts? Who can benefit from them?\": \"These are virtual wallets, established by national authorities, for every person of working age. This includes the employed, self-employed, those in atypical forms of work, and the unemployed and people outside the labour force. As part of the proposal, national authorities would ensure adequate annual provision of individual training entitlements to these accounts, with higher amounts for people most in need of training. People would be able to accumulate these entitlements and use them throughout their career. This would allow people to embark on longer or more costly training or to train in order to update or complete their skills' set and in response to emerging skills needs in the labour market. Beyond the account itself and the provision of an entitlement, an enabling framework is essential to help people take up training. This framework should include access to career guidance and validation opportunities, paid training leave, a public national registry of quality-assured and labour market relevant training that is eligible for funding from the learning accounts and a single national digital portal with a secure electronic authentication and connection to the registry. It will be for Member States to decide on the design of the individual learning accounts, including the amount and financing of entitlements, as well as on how the enabling framework will be delivered.\", \"What are micro-credentials? Who can benefit from them?\": \"A micro-credential is the record of the learning outcomes that a learner has acquired following a small learning experience (e.g. certificate, award). Micro-credentials are already widely used in many education and training sectors, professions and labour markets. The aim of the Commission's proposal is to establish a European approach that gives a common definition for micro-credentials, provides common standards, and improves recognition across borders. Micro-credentials can support targeted, flexible upskilling and reskilling to meet new and emerging needs in society and the labour market. Given their flexibility, micro-credentials can be designed and delivered by a variety of providers in many different settings. Micro-credentials can be used as part of targeted measures to support labour market activation and inclusion. Micro-credentials are not limited to any category of the population. They are for everyone, regardless of age, employment or education level.\", \"Why do we need individual learning accounts and micro-credentials?\": \"The success of both the digital and green transitions depends on workers with the right skills, and the need to act fast puts high demands on Member States' support systems for continuous learning. Moreover, demographic change in Europe means that we need to activate everyone's full potential, in order to ensure sustainable growth. Lastly, recovering from the socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic requires a reinforced policy on skills to support successful professional transitions where needed. Skills development is a fundamental part of the response to these challenges and open the door to more job opportunities. Skills are a centrepiece of the European way of life as they are a key driver for individuals' success in a fast changing labour market. However, so far, not enough people are taking part in learning and training to expand their knowledge and skills once they leave formal education. In 2016, only 37% of adults participated in annual training. The European Pillar of Social Action Plan includes a 2030 target that at least 60% of all adults should participate in training every year. Our proposals for individual learning accounts and micro-credentials will make it easier for people to access quality-assured learning and training opportunities, make their skills more visible and get support in order to identify learning opportunities that help them improve their career, studies and personal development.\", \"What is the link between the Commission's proposals for individual learning accounts and micro-credentials?\": \"The proposals offer concrete tools that make it easier for individuals to step into learning and help them advance in their careers. At a practical level, Member States can include training courses leading to micro-credentials in their registry of recognised opportunities that are eligible for funding from individual learning accounts.\", \"How do micro-credentials relate to existing qualifications?\": \"Micro-credentials are complementary to traditional, formal qualifications. There are already thousands of micro-credentials on offer by higher education and Vocational Education and Training (VET) institutions, private providers, public and non-profit bodies, government departments and international organisations. The European approach to micro-credentials seeks to enhance the quality, transparency and use of these micro-credentials.\", \"Will people be able to pursue any type of learning activity they want, whenever they want?\": \"For individual learning accounts, Member States are invited to work closely with social partners and relevant partners to establish the learning accounts and supporting framework, including a public national registry with eligible training. Within this framework, learners will be able to choose where, when and what to learn, in line with their career goals, personal needs and reflecting job and skills demand on the labour market. The aim is to ensure people's ownership of their accounts, keeping their training entitlements even when they move between jobs, between work and learning, employment and unemployment, and activity and inactivity.\", \"How will these initiatives be implemented?\": \"Once adopted by the Council, Member States are encouraged to implement these initiatives: Member States are invited to put in place individual learning accounts and an enabling framework to support people in finding the most suitable labour market relevant training opportunities, by working closely together with social partners and relevant stakeholders. They are invited to systematically monitor and evaluate the operation of the individual learning accounts and enabling framework and make adjustments as needed to achieve the objective of this Recommendation in the most efficient way. Social partners have a key role in helping Member States design national individual learning accounts and the enabling framework.On micro-credentials, the Recommendation will be implemented by the Member States and any provider of micro-credentials. This includes education and training institutions, such as higher education institutions and vocational education and training organisations, as well as social partners, employers and industry, civil society organisations and national authorities. They will work together to design, deliver and issue micro-credentials for formal, non-formal and informal learning.\", \"How will the individual learning accounts be funded?\": \"Member States will determine the arrangements for ensuring adequate and sustainable funding of individual learning accounts. Individual learning accounts support the idea of cost-sharing, as they allow contributions from different sources, such as public authorities and employers, to be bundled and managed in a single account. For example, Public Employment Services could help fund additional individual training entitlements for unemployed people, and employers could provide top-ups for their employees (including as an outcome of collective bargaining agreements). Member States may also benefit from EU support, including from the European Social Fund Plus, the European Regional Development Fund and the Just Transition Fund, as well as the Recovery and Resilience Facility. The Erasmus+ programme can also provide support to education and training organisations to develop small courses leading to micro-credentials.\", \"How will people have access to individual learning accounts?\": \"The proposal recommends that Member States set up and maintain a single national digital portal, easily accessible via mobile devices (e.g. through a digital app). This portal will increase transparency on available training and support opportunities at national level and allow users to access easily their individual accounts, review their available individual training entitlements and consult the national registry of training offers.\", \"Will individual learning accounts replace training schemes that already exist?\": \"The proposal does not aim to replace existing schemes. It is complementary to existing schemes like the social partner training funds. Individual learning accounts can help increase training participation urgently needed to successfully master the green and digital transition. The possibility of accumulating training entitlements and the availability of accounts for all working-age adults, including those who do not have an employment contract and cannot benefit from employer-organised training, can make a real difference.\", \"What do these initiatives mean for employers?\": \"Employers have a key role in supporting the upskilling and reskilling of working-age adults and should be active partners in the design and roll-out of both initiatives. They can provide information on new and emerging skills needs and help design, and ensure the relevance of individual learning accounts and micro-credentials. They can help by providing guidance and information on training and career development opportunities and contributing to decisions on training (including courses leading to micro-credentials) included in the national registry supporting individual learning accounts. They can also provide funding to employees' accounts and grant paid training leave.\", \"What is the role of higher education institutions in providing small learning courses leading to micro-credentials?\": \"Higher education and training organisations are already actively exploring and developing the use of micro-credentials. Higher education institutions have the capacity and experience with innovative teaching methods, as well as established quality assurance processes that can be adapted for micro-credentials. Strong cooperation between education and training organisations and the private sector is essential to provide both high quality and relevant education and training offers, in particular for the short learning experiences. Providing small learning courses can expand the higher education institutions' role in providing continuous and lifelong learning. By offering new flexible ways of learning and by ensuring an easier certification of these short learning courses, it will also encourage and facilitate the participation of more diverse groups of learners in higher education. Through the co-creation of content and close exchange when it comes to the required competences and skills, micro-credentials could help further improve the responsiveness of higher education to the needs of the labour market and expand the outreach and societal relevance of higher education.\", \"Can micro-credentials be \\u2018stacked' to lead to a full degree?\": \"Any decision to stack or combine micro-credentials to create larger credentials such as degrees is to be made by the relevant authority in charge of awarding degrees. While some countries allow for the stacking of several micro-credentials to be combined into a full or partial degree, the proposal neither promotes nor excludes the possibility. Each country is responsible of organising its own system for education and training.\", \"How do micro-credentials fit in with existing initiatives like Europass and the European Qualifications Framework?\": \"Europass is a framework of tools and services to help people manage their careers and lifelong learning. Elements of the Europass framework can be used as part of the EU approach to micro-credentials: individual users of Europass can store and share information on their micro-credentials in a secure way in their Europass profile;providers can issue digital, authentic, and tamper-proof micro-credentials using European Digital Credentials for Learning (which were established through Europass); and,information on micro-credentials can be published on the \\u2018search courses' section of Europass. The European Qualifications Framework is a learning outcomes-based framework for all types of qualifications. It serves as a translation tool between different national qualifications frameworks. Micro-credentials may be included in national qualifications frameworks, where relevant, and in line with national priorities and decisions.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6621\": {\"What is the scope of the draft Guidelines and who is covered by them?\": \"The draft Guidelines are part of a package also including a proposal for a Directive on improving working conditions in platform work and a Communication on harnessing the full benefits of digitalisation for the future of work. The draft Guidelines cover self-employed people who have little influence over their working conditions either because: a) they are in a situation comparable to workers; or b) because they are in an imbalanced negotiating position towards their counterparty. The draft Guidelines explain under which circumstances self-employed may be considered to fall into the first or the second category. Both categories cover only solo self-employed persons, namely, service providers who do not have any employees and who rely primarily on their own personal labour for the provision of the services. The undertakings/counterparties of these categories of solo self-employed persons are also covered when negotiating with the latter their working conditions. The draft Guidelines cover all collective negotiations/agreements between the solo self-employed persons and their counterparty/-ies to the extent that such agreements concern the working conditions of the solo self-employed persons. Negotiations or agreements concerning directly or indirectly the terms and conditions imposed on consumers are not covered by the draft Guidelines. Similarly, the draft Guidelines do not cover agreements that are not made with a counterparty. The draft Guidelines include relevant examples to illustrate the scope of the Guidelines.\", \"Which categories of solo self-employed persons are considered to be in an unbalanced negotiating position, according to the draft Guidelines?\": \"The draft Guidelines identify two categories of such solo self-employed persons: solo self-employed persons facing an imbalance in bargaining power due to negotiation with counterparties of a certain economic strength. This is the case, in particular, when solo self-employed persons are providing their services to counterparties, which represent the whole sector or industry. The same stands for the cases where solo self-employed persons deal with counterparty/-ies whose annual aggregate turnover equals or exceeds \\u20ac2 million or their staff headcount exceeds 10 workers (individually or jointly).solo self-employed persons entitled to bargain collectively pursuant to national or EU legislation. In certain cases, the national or EU legislator has identified situations where solo self-employed may need access to collective bargaining in order to address their unbalanced negotiating position. In particular, some national laws, in pursuit of social objectives, either explicitly grant the right to collective bargaining to certain professions or economically dependent self-employed or exclude them from the application of national competition law. The EU Copyright Directive also foresees the possibility of collective bargaining for authors and performers in order to ensure a fair and appropriate remuneration for the exploitation of their works.\", \"Which categories of solo self-employed persons are considered by the draft Guidelines as \\u201ccomparable to workers\\u201d?\": \"On the basis of the Albany and FNV Kunsten judgments, the draft Guidelines provide that the collective agreements regarding the working conditions of solo self-employed persons who are in a situation \\u201ccomparable to that of workers\\u201d fall outside the scope of Article 101 TFEU. The draft Guidelines identify three categories of such solo self-employed persons: economically dependent solo self-employed persons, i.e. solo self-employed providing their services exclusively or predominantly to one counterparty. In order to facilitate this assessment, the draft Guidelines provide that solo self-employed who depend on one counterparty for at least 50% of their work-related income shall be considered as economically dependent.solo self-employed working \\u201cside-by-side\\u201d with workers, i.e. solo self-employed who provide the same or similar tasks \\u201cside-by-side\\u201d with workers working for the same counterparty.solo self-employed persons providing their services to or through a digital labour platform. This category mirrors the increasing trend of national jurisprudence and newly introduced laws recognising the economic dependence of these solo self-employed on digital labour platforms. The term \\u201cdigital labour platform\\u201d is defined in the same way in the draft Guidelines and the Commission proposal for a Directive on improving working conditions in platform work.\", \"What is the difference between the categories excluded from Article 101 TFEU and those where the Commission commits not to intervene?\": \"Certain collective agreements are considered to fall outside the scope of Article 101 TFEU in so far as certain conditions are fulfilled. These are the agreements on working conditions of solo self-employed who can be considered to be in a position comparable to workers (e.g. economically dependent self-employed). Some solo self-employed may not be in a position comparable to workers, but may nevertheless have little influence over their working conditions (such as e.g. artists and performers negotiating a fair remuneration in line with the Copyright Directive). Collective agreements on the working conditions of such self-employed, could still fall under the scope of Article 101 TFEU, but  the Commission here commits not to act against any such agreements.\", \"I am a musician and use my own instrument whenever I play for an orchestra as self-employed, can I use these Guidelines?\": \"Solo self-employed who use certain goods or assets as an ancillary means for the provision of services fall under the scope of the draft Guidelines. For example, musicians who use their own musical instrument or cleaners who bring their own accessories (such as specific clothes or cleaning products) in order to provide their services would be covered by the scope of the draft Guidelines. However,  sharing or exploitation of goods or assets (e.g. rental of housing) or the (re-)sale of goods/services (e.g. resale of automotive parts) do not fall under these draft Guidelines\", \"How do these draft Guidelines relate to the promotion of social policy?\": \"The draft Guidelines do not introduce any social measures and they will not change the definitions of the terms \\u201cworker\\u201d or \\u201cself-employed person\\u201d under national law. Also, they do not affect the possibility for individuals, in particular false self-employed, to challenge the designation of their employment status through administrative or judicial procedures and be reclassified as workers by national authorities or courts. The draft Guidelines only explain how the Commission will apply EU competition rules to collective agreements on the working conditions of some self-employed persons in a weak position. The prerogatives of the Member States in social policy or the autonomy of the social partners will not be affected.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6566\": {\"What is the social economy?\": \"There are 2.8 million social economy entities in Europe that employ 13.6 million people and which offer solutions to key challenges in our societies. Social economy organisations are entities which put social and environmental purposes before profit (\\u201cpeople and planet first\\u201d). They reinvest most of their profit back into the organisation or a social cause, and have a democratic or participatory form of governance (\\u201cbottom-up\\u201d). The social economy includes a variety of businesses, organisations and legal entities, such as social enterprises, cooperatives, mutual benefit societies (a specific type of collective insurance), non-profit associations and foundations. They operate in many economic sectors, such as social services, health care, social housing, affordable and renewable energy, circular economy, agriculture, financial and insurance activities, culture, media and recreation. Here are some examples of social enterprises, supported by the European Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI): In Austria, the social enterprise Sign Time is leading the SiMAX project for developing a digital technology which provides real-time sign language translation and removes communication barriers for people with hearing disabilities.The HomeLab project developed and tested Social Rental Enterprise (SRE) models for integrated housing and labour services for marginalised groups in Czechia, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia.In France, Makesense Seed is a fund to support early-stage social enterprises with investments of up to \\u20ac500,000.\", \"What is the Social Economy Action Plan and why do we need it?\": \"The social economy has an important untapped economic and job creation potential. It can play a key role in a fair and inclusive recovery from the pandemic, as well as in the green and digital transitions. Social economy organisations create and retain quality jobs, and contribute to social and labour market inclusion. They drive sustainable economic development, promote the active participation of citizens, and play an important role in Europe's welfare systems. To realise its full potential, it is important to raise the social economy's visibility and create an environment that enables the social economy to thrive and grow. The Action Plan focuses on three main areas: Creating the right conditions for the social economy to thrive The Action Plan proposes measures to help design regulations and policies that are better adapted to the social economy at all relevant levels, thereby creating an enabling framework for the social economy to thrive. Opening opportunities for social economy organisations to start up and scale up The Action Plan will open up new opportunities for the social economy, for example by facilitating access to funding, business support, and networks. Making sure the social economy and its potential are recognised The Action Plan aims to increase the recognition of the social economy and its potential, by making it more visible through research, evidence gathering and communication activities.\", \"Who can benefit from the Social Economy Action Plan?\": \"Social economy entities will benefit from the Action Plan as it aims to improve their visibility and recognition, support the development of enabling policy and legal environments, and make it easier to access funding and business support. The Action Plan will help make the social economy better known and understood, including among young people, investors and public authorities. More generally, the social economy has a wider societal impact and potential, for instance by contributing to social and labour market inclusion. The social economy therefore contributes to implementing the European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan, including its three 2030 EU headline targets, for instance the increase of the employment rate to 78% and the reduction of the number of people at risk of poverty and social exclusion by at least 15 million.\", \"How will the Action Plan help make the economy work for people?\": \"Paid employment in the social economy varies between 0.6% and 9.9% amongst Member States. Therefore, the social economy has a significant untapped potential for job creation in many countries. The Action Plan will help social economy entities to scale up their impact and activities, including across EU borders, for example, by facilitating access to business support and funding. Boosting the social economy is also a way to create more jobs. The social economy employs some 13.6 million people in the EU and makes an important contribution to GDP in the countries where it is most developed. For this reason, it has been included in the \\u201cProximity and Social Economy\\u201d ecosystem, one of the 14 industrial ecosystems identified in the update of the EU Industrial Strategy.\", \"How will local communities benefit from the Social Economy Action Plan?\": \"Social economy business models bring value to local economies and societies by contributing to their inclusiveness, resilience and sustainability. They have strong local roots and aim to serve the community where they are based, for instance by retaining economic activities and revenues locally. As such, they contribute to drive local economic development in sectors specifically relevant to the regions, for example in rural areas, in relation to agriculture and organic food production or in the blue economy (industries and sectors related to oceans, seas and coasts). They foster short value chains facilitating local production and consumption, and support the circular economy. As part of the Action Plan, the Commission will support Member States and stakeholders to boost the social economy and social innovation in rural areas and will expand the European Social Economy Regions network to reinforce new regional and local partnerships. It will also work with cities to develop Local Green Deals or green citizenship actions.\", \"How will the Action Plan contribute to fair green and digital transitions?\": \"The social economy is an important driver of fair and inclusive green and digital transitions. It contributes to the development of sustainable practices, for instance in the fields of the circular economy, organic agriculture, renewable energy, housing and mobility. The social economy can also provide solutions for those impacted by the green and digital transitions, for example through training and reskilling workers, and by providing job opportunities. It can also contribute to tackling the digital divide and ensuring that the digital transition leaves no one behind. Social economy actors working on \\\"Tech4good\\\" for example deploy digital technologies, (e.g. blockchain technology, big data, artificial intelligence) to achieve a green and social impact. As part of the Action Plan, the Commission will help the social economy to adopt and develop green practices, products and services, and to improve its digital capacities. A Commission Staff Working Document, coming along with the Action Plan, launches scenarios for a \\u201ctransition pathway\\u201d to accelerate the green and digital transition of the social economy, as part of the Proximity and Social economy industrial ecosystem, involving engagement with public authorities and interested parties.\", \"How will the Action Plan support social innovation?\": \"By operating in a bottom-up way and being close to communities, citizens and the problems they face, social economy entities have the capacity to find and implement innovative solutions. With this Action Plan, the Commission wants to help successful ideas to be replicated across the EU. This is also the objective of the new European Competence Centre for Social Innovation, which will be set up in 2022. The Action Plan also aims to make it easier to pool resources for social innovation from the public sector, philanthropic and social investment actors.\", \"How will the plan be implemented and by whom?\": \"The Action Plan announces a set of actions by the Commission to strengthen the social economy. It also encourages Member States and other actors to put in place actions to support its implementation and to make the most of the opportunities it offers. The Commission encourages Member States to adopt or update their social economy strategies and initiatives in cooperation with social economy stakeholders. It also calls on Member States to designate social economy coordinators. The Commission will take stock in 2025, looking at progress made and remaining barriers.\", \"Where will the funding for the Action Plan come from?\": \"The Commission's ambition is to increase the level of support for the social economy under EU funds in the 2021-2027 period. It will for instance launch new financial products in 2022 under the InvestEU programme aimed at mobilising private financing. Other EU programmes that will offer dedicated or indirect support for the social economy include the Employment and Social Innovation strand of the European Social Fund Plus, Horizon Europe, the Single Market Programme, Erasmus+ and the LIFE Programme. At national level, EU funding will be available for example via the Cohesion Policy Funds and national recovery and resilience plans where applicable.\", \"What is the transition pathway and how will it work?\": \"Presented in the context of the updated EU Industrial Strategy, transition pathways for industrial ecosystems are created in partnership with stakeholders such as industry, public authorities and social economy stakeholders. It will accompany the twin transition of the \\u201cProximity and Social Economy\\u201d industrial ecosystem and contribute to the implementation of the Action Plan in this area. The Commission seeks public views on the transition pathway through an EU survey open until 28 February 2022.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_654\": {\"Why is a new Roaming Regulation needed?\": \"Thanks to the EU Roaming Regulation, roaming charges ended on 15 June 2017. Europeans travelling within the EU only pay domestic prices for calls, SMS and data. The current regulation is in place until 30 June 2022. In November 2019, the Commission published an extensive review of the roaming market, showing that travelers across the EU have benefitted significantly from the end of roaming charges. It is therefore important to preserve these benefits by prolonging the existing regulation. The review shows that without continuing the existing framework, the conditions on the mobile telecoms market would still not ensure an economically sustainable \\u2018roam like at home' for operators offering roaming services to everyone travelling in the EU. The Commission also carried out a public consultation, in the period June to September 2020, to collect views on retail and wholesale roaming services as well as on the impact of prolonging and reviewing these rules. Building on the outcome of the public consultation, the Commission proposed on 24 February 2021 a new Roaming Regulation aimed at extending the rules for another 10 years and further enhancing its benefits for the citizens. The new Regulation is set to come into force on 1 July 2022, in time to ensure continued \\u2018Roam like at home' benefits for European consumers.\", \"What will change in the new Roaming Regulation?\": \"The new regulation will extend the current rules and will bring new additions. First, consumers will have access to the same services abroad in the EU as at home, when the same networks and technologies are available on the network in the visited Member State. A roaming customer who can use 5G services at home should also have 5G roaming services when this is available in the visited Member State. Second, consumers will be better informed about the types of services that can bring additional costs, such as calling customer service numbers, helpdesks or insurance companies. These services can be free of charge or cost less when phoning from home, but when roaming additional charges may apply. Third, consumers will be informed by way of short message (SMS) about additional charges for using roaming services on so-called non-terrestrial networks. Such networks are usually used for mobile connections on board planes and boats and are not covered by roaming rules. Roaming on such networks will often bring additional costs. When citizens travel by plane or boat, their mobile phones may unintentionally connect to a non-terrestrial network. Operators should also offer tools for the customers to avoid additional costs such as opting out from connections to non-terrestrial networks. In addition, roaming services will be automatically interrupted when the consumer reaches a total cost of \\u20ac50, or another predefined limit, to avoid further charges. This also applies to roaming outside the Union. The new Regulation also ensures that at wholesale level, operators inform each other on how to ensure access to emergency services and caller location, not only for calls to \\u2018112' but also for alternative means of access. Roaming customers receive a message when they enter a Member State with information about calls to \\u2018112' and other available means of access to emergency services. Operator should ensure awareness of emergency services for end-users with disabilities. Roaming customers will be informed via the national public warning applications where these are available.\", \"Who will benefit from the new Roaming Regulation?\": \"The new Roaming Regulation will benefit European citizens, businesses and operators alike. The new rules will enhance the \\u2018Roam like at home' experience of citizens, who will be able to enjoy the same mobile network quality and speed abroad, as they enjoy at home. Operators will be able to continue providing \\u2018Roam like at home' services in an economically sustainable way. This is because on one hand the new rules include lower wholesale rate caps, i.e. the maximum prices that the domestic operator pays the operator abroad to provide roaming services. On the other hand, the new wholesale rate caps also ensure cost recovery for visited operators and can help further increase roaming traffic. Businesses will benefit from improved connectivity in the Single Market. This is particularly important for application developers and start-ups, because it implies that consumers can continuously use their innovative applications and services as they travel across borders in the EU, without network interruptions.\", \"Will consumers have the same network speed guaranteed while roaming?\": \"In order to provide roaming services to their customers, operators have to use networks that are available in other EU countries and managed by other operators. Since network availability throughout the EU varies, the same mobile network speed may not always be available. However, the new rules aim to ensure that when similar quality or speeds are available in the visited network, the domestic operator should ensure the same quality of the roaming service. In other words, if a consumer has access to 5G connectivity at home, he or she should not have 4G connectivity while roaming, as long as 5G is available at the visited location. According to the new roaming proposal, operators should inform their customers of the quality of services they can expect while roaming, by stating this in the roaming contract and publishing information on their website.\", \"What are \\u2018value-added services' and why should consumers be aware of those while roaming?\": \"Communications to some phone numbers are charged in a specific way because of the added value of the service. Examples may be customer care services offered by insurance companies or banks. They also include entertainment services, for example calling a specific number to vote for winner in a popular TV programme. For domestic calls to numbers that provide value added services, the costs vary: for example, they may be free or they may cost more than regular calls. Since they are subject to special charging schemes domestically, when roaming these calls typically entail additional charges that the customer may not expect. For example, a call that is free at home may not be free or may be more expensive than expected while roaming. The proposed new regulation aims at providing transparency to consumers about value-added services and increasing their awareness about phone numbers that may be used to access value-added services. The objective is to give consumers practical tools to make informed choices about using value-added services numbers while roaming and avoid \\u2018bill shocks'. Operators can ensure this by including information about the types of services that may be subject to higher charges in roaming in their contracts with the consumers. In addition, when citizens are entering another EU country, they should receive an SMS about potential increased charges from using such services. The SMS should include a link to a dedicated webpage providing additional information on the types of services and, if available, about the relevant phone numbering ranges.\", \"How will the new rules ensure citizens' effective access to emergency services, particularly through alternative means, when roaming?\": \"The single European emergency number, 112, it set up in a way that ensures that everyone calling  number has effective access to emergency services while roaming everywhere in the EU. Dialing the emergency numbers and transmitting information on the location of the caller while roaming should be seamless and for free. Likewise, citizens who cannot place a call to 112 should be able to access emergency services free of charge through alternative means when roaming, for example through real time text or a smartphone application. The new roaming rules also reinforce access to emergency services, through calls and alternative means of communications in case of cross border use. It will also ensure that the transmission of caller location will be seamless and free of charge while using roaming services. EU travelers should also be well informed about the available means of accessing emergency services in the visited Member State. Therefore, the new regulation will ensure that roaming customers are provided information about the single European emergency number, 112, but also about alternative, non-voice means of access for end-users with disabilities. In addition, in Member States where public warning mobile applications are deployed, roaming customers will be notified of the existence thereof and instruction on how to download the app concerned. This is complementary to the existing requirement that Member States deliver public warning messages to end-users, without the need of prior action by a roaming customer.\", \"How will the Roaming Regulation ensure that \\u2018Roam like at home' is economically sustainable for operators and regulate wholesale caps?\": \"The regulation of wholesale caps, i.e. the maximum prices that a visited operator may charge the other operator while roaming, is an essential element for the sustainability of \\u2018roam like at home' for operators and continues to be necessary based on the assessment of current technological and business developments. The review of the roaming market in the EU showed that wholesale caps should be further reduced.  The co-legislators agreed on a gradual reduction of the wholesale caps from 2022 onwards. These caps reflect decreasing operators' wholesale costs of providing roaming services, provide sufficient investment incentives and maximise sustainability for EU operators.

The data volume that is available when roaming on the basis of unlimited data is determined by a calculation that is based on the wholesale charge. The exceptional surcharges that operators can apply are also based on the wholesale charges. Therefore, if the wholesale charges decrease, the surcharge decreases and the minimum data volumes available for roaming in the Union will increase for subscriptions with unlimited domestic data volumes and the likelihood of operators exceptionally applying surcharges will decrease.\", \"What will happen with the \\u2018fair use' policies?\": \"Operators will still be able to apply a \\u2018fair use' policy. The rules on the \\u2018fair use' policy remain the same. This means that if a person is traveling to another EU country periodically, then this person can use roaming. If a person moved to live in another EU country, then it is better to move to a local contract, as permanent roaming is no longer considered as \\u2018fair use'.\", \"How does the Roaming Regulation facilitate innovation?\": \"The new Roaming Regulation will ensure that consumers and businesses can use mobile services with the same quality of service as at home and that operators inform their customers adequately about the quality they can expect abroad. The regulation also includes measures to ensure that operators can have access to all network generations and technologies necessary in other EU countries to provide the same services to citizens abroad as the ones they provide domestically. For application developers and start-ups, this means that consumers can continuously use their innovative applications and services as they travel across borders in the EU, without network interruptions. This is particularly relevant for applications that offer mobility solutions, accommodation, or other services related to tourism and all those applications that might be particularly useful while travelling. The EU is investing in developing and using innovative digital solutions, such as 5G (and in the future 6G) networks. The quality of service will likely become an increasingly important element of the mobile service offer. As concerns 5G services, it will become more and more important for consumers travelling abroad to know if they could be affected by limitations in available network quality when using certain applications and services. The new roaming rules aim to enable innovation and business development, ensuring the widest use of innovative services and minimising the risk that citizens would not be able to use certain applications requiring the latest network technology, such as 5G, when crossing internal EU borders.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6606\": {\"What are the main challenges the Commission's proposals aim to tackle and how?\": \"The aim is to improve working conditions in platform work and, at the same time, support the opportunities, innovation and flexibility the platform economy offers. Challenges can range from misclassification of people's employment status, to a lack of transparency and predictability of their contractual arrangements, as well as health and safety risks, and inadequate access to social protection. The Commission's proposals aim to: Correctly determine the employment status of platform workers through a set of clear criteria, giving them access to existing labour and social rights, including right to a minimum wage (where it exists), collective bargaining, working time and health protection, the right to paid leave or improved access to protection against work accidents, unemployment and sickness benefits, as well as old-age pensions.  This will also bring increased legal certainty for digital labour platforms which will be faced with reduced litigation costs and less administrative burden by avoiding individual court cases;Provide more transparency, rights and accountability with regards to algorithmic management on digital labour platforms by helping people to better understand how tasks are allocated and prices are set, and enable them to contest decisions that affect working conditions if needed;Improve enforcement and traceability of platform work, including in cross-border situations by asking platforms to declare the work in the country where it is performed and make available to national authorities certain information about the people who work through them and their terms and conditions;Strengthen collective bargaining and social dialogue. The proposed Directive introduces the need to inform and consult platform workers and their representatives on algorithmic management decisions. It asks digital labour platforms to facilitate communication channels for people working through them to organise themselves, and to be contacted by workers' representatives. The draft guidelines empower solo self-employed people \\u2013 including those working through digital labour platforms \\u2013 to influence and improve their working conditions through collective bargaining and increased social dialogue.\", \"How can EU action help improve working conditions in the platform economy?\": \"So far, very few EU Member States have adopted national legislation specifically targeting the improvement of working conditions and/or access to social protection in platform work. In most cases, national legislation only tackles platform work challenges indirectly. In addition, where national legislation on platform work has been introduced, it only focuses on specific sectors, notably ride-hailing and delivery services. On the other hand, litigation is on the rise. To date, there are more than 100 court decisions and 15 administrative decisions in the EU dealing with the employment status of people working through platforms. In most cases, the judges have ruled to reclassify independent contractors as workers, and platforms as employers. A few have confirmed the self-employed status. Many more court decisions are pending. A common EU legal framework will grant platforms and self-employed people the legal clarity they need to conduct their activities, also helping them to more easily expand their operations across the Single Market and make the most of its business opportunities. It will also level the playing field among platform companies and vis-a\\u0300-vis traditional businesses that employ workers. An EU legal framework also establishes minimum rights for all people working through platforms in the EU, which will improve their working conditions.\", \"What are digital labour platforms?\": \"Digital labour platforms are internet-based companies that intermediate and organise the work provided by workers or self-employed people to third-party clients. The work can either be provided in a specific physical location \\u201con location\\u201d (e.g. food delivery, ride-hailing) or online (e.g. data encoding, translation services). The business model of digital labour platforms builds on algorithm-based technologies to efficiently match supply and demand for labour or services. These platforms offer possibilities for people to make a living or earn additional income. Especially those who otherwise might face difficulties to enter the labour market can benefit, such as young people, people with a migrant background or those with caring responsibilities.\", \"What is the current state of the EU platform economy?\": \"There are more than 500 digital labour platforms active in the EU. They include international companies as well as small national or local start-ups. The majority of these platforms provide \\u201con-location\\u201d services. Revenues from the platform economy in the EU are estimated to be as high as \\u20ac20 billion. However, today, digital labour platforms are faced with a patchwork of different laws and rulings across the EU, which makes it difficult for them to expand their business across borders. More than 28 million people in the EU work through digital labour platforms. By 2025, their number is expected to reach 43 million. However, around 55% of people working through platforms earn less than the net hourly minimum wage of the country they are working in. On average, people working through platforms spend 8.9 hours per week doing unpaid tasks (e.g. researching tasks, waiting for assignments), versus 12.6 hours doing paid tasks.\", \"What is the relationship between platform companies and the people who work through these companies?\": \"Platform work can be subject to different degrees of control by the platform. Depending on the degree of supervision, digital labour platforms can be considered as employers of people, whose work they organise and control. \\u201cPeople working through platforms\\u201d or \\u201cpersons performing platform work\\u201d refers to individuals whose work is organised through a digital labour platform, regardless of their legal employment status (worker, self-employed or any third-category status, which may exist at Member State level). To date, over 90% of digital labour platforms in the EU classify the people working through them as self-employed. Out of the estimated 28 million people working through platforms in the EU, 5.5 million may be currently misclassified. The remaining 22.5 million people are deemed to be correctly classified, either as workers or as self-employed. As a result, some people working through digital labour platforms are denied the labour and social rights that would come with an employment status. These include the right to a minimum wage (where it exists), collective bargaining, working time and health protection, the right to paid leave or improved access to protection against work accidents, unemployment, sickness and old-age pension. At the same time, the genuinely self-employed people working through platforms will obtain more clarity on their terms and conditions and be able to better understand the mechanisms underpinning the assignment and proposal of tasks. This should improve their income security and predictability.\", \"What are the main elements of the proposed Directive?\": \"The Directive the Commission proposes today: Provides a list of criteria to determine whether a digital labour platform exercises control over a person, and therefore whether the person should be presumed to be a worker. If at least two of the criteria are met, the platform is considered an employer.Asks Member States to ensure that the presumption of the employment status is effective, and can be enforced as well as be rebutted. This includes establishing a framework to ensure that the legal presumption applies in all relevant administrative and legal proceedings and that enforcement authorities, such as labour inspectorates or social protection bodies, can rely on that presumption. Member States should also take supporting measures to ensure the effective implementation of the legal presumption, such as developing relevant guidance for digital labour platforms, people working through platforms, social partners and enforcement authorities. Member States should also strengthen controls and field inspections.Establishes a new set of rights for people subject to algorithmic management in platform work. Such rights will provide workers and their representatives with the necessary information about how their work and assignments are allocated, accounts are rated or terminated. The new rights will also ensure human monitoring and review of decisions that significantly impact the working conditions.Asks digital labour platforms to declare work in the country where it is performed and provide national authorities with information on people working through them and their terms and conditions. This will lead to improved monitoring and enforcement.\", \"How will the \\u2018rebuttable presumption' of the employment status work in practice?\": \"The rules proposed by the Commission today look at the platform rather than at the individual worker. When a platform exercises a certain degree of control over the people performing work through it, the platform will be \\u2018presumed' to be an employer. This means that people working through it under the same conditions will be \\u2018presumed' to be workers. The proposed Directive clarifies that the correct determination of the employment status should be based on the principle of the primacy of facts, i.e. guided primarily by the facts relating to the actual performance of work and the remuneration, taking into account the use of algorithms in platform work, and not by how the relationship is defined in the contract. The proposal puts forward a list of criteria, of which at least two need to be fulfilled for platforms to be presumed to be employers. The criteria in the draft Directive will help determine the degree of control, for instance looking at any restrictions on the freedom of people to organise their work. The criteria are: determining the level of remuneration or setting upper limits;supervising the performance of work through electronic means;restricting the freedom to choose one's working hours or periods of absence, to accept or to refuse tasks or to use subcontractors or substitutes;setting specific binding rules with regard to appearance, conduct towards the recipient of the service or performance of the work;restricting the possibility to build a client base or to perform work for any third party. In practice, this means all national authorities, including social security bodies, will consider and treat digital labour platforms who meet at least two of the criteria as employers. Those platforms will therefore have to fulfil their obligations as employers under national and EU law vis-a\\u0300-vis their presumed workers, for instance with regard to providing minimum wages (where it exists) or respecting working time, and annual and family-related leaves. Some platforms might chose to adjust their terms and conditions to ensure that they can work with the self-employed. However, it will always be possible to challenge (\\u2018rebut') the employment status presumption and thereby undo its legal effects. To do this, the platform or person affected will have to prove that the relationship is not an employment relationship under national definitions and that therefore the person or certain category of persons should be considered self-employed. Where the digital labour platform argues that the contractual relationship in question is not an employment relationship, the burden of proof would be on the platform. Where the person performing the platform work argues that the contractual relationship in question is not an employment relationship, the platform would be required to assist the proper resolution of the proceedings, notably by providing all the relevant information. When transposing the Directive, Member States should not only transpose the presumption and rebuttal in their national legal and administrative proceedings but should also put in place measures that help its implementation. They should make information publicly available on the presumption of the employment status, develop guidance for the digital labour platforms and the people performing platform work, and strengthen controls and inspections by labour inspectorates and other bodies.\", \"What is algorithmic management and what are the new rights proposed in this regard?\": \"Algorithmic management refers to information technology-driven automated monitoring and decision-making systems that increasingly replace the functions of managers in businesses, e.g. allocating tasks, monitoring and evaluating the work performed, providing incentives or imposing sanctions. Digital labour platforms use algorithmic systems to organise and manage the people performing platform work through their applications or websites. People working through platforms often lack information about how the algorithms work and how decisions are taken. This includes a lack of information on how personal data is used. The proposed Directive aims to: Increase transparency: People doing platform work will have the right to be informed by digital labour platforms about the automated monitoring and decision-making systems that are in use and how they affect their working conditions. For instance, they will receive information on how they are being monitored, supervised and evaluated, including by clients. They will also receive information on the elements that lead to or support significant decisions, such as allocating tasks, proposing fees and granting bonuses. Worker representatives and labour authorities will also get access to such information.Protect personal data: Digital labour platforms will not be able to collect or process any personal data that is not directly related to the work performed. They will also not be allowed to collect data while the person is not logged into the relevant app or the website.Ensure human monitoring: Digital labour platforms will have to monitor and evaluate the impact of individual decisions taken or supported by automated monitoring and decision-making systems on working conditions, such as pay or working time.Make it possible to contest automated decisions: People doing platform work will obtain the right to receive explanations for significant automated decisions that affect their working conditions and to contest these. Digital labour platforms will have to ensure that people performing platform work have access to a human contact at the digital labour platform to discuss decisions that significantly impact them. If asked to review its decision, the platform has to respond within a week. In case the decision breaches the person's rights, the digital labour platform must correct the decision or provide compensation.\", \"Will all types of platforms and all people working through digital platforms be covered by the new rules?\": \"The proposed Directive will apply to digital labour platforms as defined in the proposal, i.e. those that organise work performed by individuals. It will not apply to online platforms which merely advertise offers or requests for services or display available service providers in a specific area. It will also not apply to providers of a service whose primary purpose is to exploit or share assets (e.g. short-term rental of accommodation). The proposed Directive will apply to all so-defined digital labour platforms which provide services in the EU, regardless of their place of origin, provided that the platform work organised through that digital labour platform is performed in the EU. The rebuttable presumption of the employment relationship will only apply to a subset of digital labour platforms, those that exert a certain degree of control over the people working through them. The proposal puts forward a list of criteria, of which at least two need to be fulfilled for platforms to be presumed to be employers. All people working through digital labour platforms will obtain new rights with respect to algorithmic management \\u2013 regardless of their employment status. This also means that all digital labour platforms will have to comply with the new obligations on algorithmic management vis-a\\u0300-vis the people who work through them. Those platforms, which are classified as employers, will have more obligations than otherwise, notably as regards health and safety protection obligations and information and consultation rights. Finally, all digital labour platforms will have to comply with new transparency obligations to declare the work where it is performed and provide information on the people working through them and on their terms and conditions.\", \"What will the Directive mean for self-employed people working through platforms?\": \"Over 90% of digital labour platforms active in the EU classify the people working through them as self-employed. Most of those people are genuinely autonomous in their work and can use platform work as a way to develop their entrepreneurial activities. Such genuine self-employment is making a positive contribution to job creation, business development, innovation, accessibility of services, and digitalisation in the EU. Some of the digital labour platforms that currently exercise a degree of control over people who work through them, may need to adjust their terms and conditions to ensure they truly operate with genuine self-employment. As a result, self-employed people might see their working arrangements being revised to make sure they are granted the full autonomy that self-employment entails. This will further strengthen self-employed people's ability to take advantage of their entrepreneurial possibilities for example by setting their own rates or developing their own client pool. For those who are already genuinely self-employed, nothing will change. They will retain their benefits. All self-employed people working through platforms will obtain similar rights to workers with respect to algorithmic management. This notably includes rights to an increased transparency of the automated tools deployed, and on the mechanisms to seek redress and review of algorithm-driven decisions.\", \"What will be the impact of the proposal on businesses?\": \"The new rules will benefit digital labour platforms by bringing about legal certainty for their business across the EU and support their sustainable growth. They will ensure that the new economy does not have a competitive advantage vis-a\\u0301-vis \\u201cbrick and mortar\\u201d companies by being able to save on costs through the wrong classification of platform workers as self-employed, by not paying the social benefits they are entitled to. During a phase of adaptation, some platform companies may decide to adapt their practices to avoid any risks of reclassification.\", \"What will be the impact of the proposal on Member States?\": \"The proposed rules will bring clarity on where platform work is done, by whom, and which Member States are responsible for enforcing relevant laws on tax and social protection. Clarity on the employment status and the related tax and social security contributions will support the sustainability of social protection systems and public budgets. It is estimated that Member States will receive between \\u20ac1.6 billion and \\u20ac4 billion per year in annual contributions when false self-employed are correctly classified as workers, depending on how many people are reclassified.\", \"Why did the European Commission choose a Directive and what is the legal basis for it?\": \"A Directive has the advantage of giving certainty about the minimum requirements and procedural obligations that Member States have to apply. At the same time, it leaves room for Member States to decide on the best way to implement those minimum requirements, without impinging on their competences and on the autonomy of social partners. Member States can always decide to go beyond the minimum standards of the Directive. The proposal will leave room for Member States to operate within their concepts of \\u2018worker' and \\u2018self-employed'. There will be no EU definition of a \\u2018worker' and there will be no imposition of new administrative procedures. Member States will be able to integrate the presumption of the employment status into their existing legal and administrative systems. The proposal for a Directive is based on Articles 16 and 153 (1)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU), on data protection and working conditions respectively.\", \"Going forward, will the Commission tackle non-standard and precarious work beyond platforms?\": \"Certain non-standard forms of employment are already regulated at EU level. This provides a minimum level of protection for the workers concerned and thereby combats precariousness as well as segmentation of labour markets. For instance, the three EU Directives on non-standard forms of employment (part-time, fixed-term and temporary agency work) aim at improving the protection of the increasing number of workers concerned while also recognising the labour market role of these flexible forms of employment. Moreover, the Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions Directive modernises EU labour law and adjusts it to the new world of work. It gives new rights, in particular to on-demand, domestic workers and people working through platforms that are classified as workers. The Council Recommendation on access to social protection for workers and the self-employed also addresses the challenges of access to social protection, including people working through platforms. The proposed Directive on platform work builds on and complements such instruments dealing with precarious and non-standard work. As the world of work changes quickly and technological developments accelerate, new challenges emerge that might need to be tackled in the future. The Commission will continue analysing the phenomenon and keep a close eye on any potential future needs to regulate the use of algorithms in the wider world of work.\", \"How did you ensure that the voices of platform companies and people working through them were sufficiently heard?\": \"In addition to the two-stage consultation of European social partners in accordance with Article 154 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU), the Commission held exchanges with many relevant parties to inform this initiative, including dedicated meetings with platform companies, platform workers' associations, trade unions, Member States' representatives, experts from academia and international organisations and representatives of civil society.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6643\": {\"What is the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI)?\": \"The proposed instrument is a response to the rising problem of economic coercion and aims to protect the Union's and Member States' interests and sovereign choices. It will empower the Commission to apply trade, investment or other restrictions towards any non-EU country unduly interfering in the policy choices of the EU or its Member States. Deterrence is its primary function, therefore the instrument would be most successful if there is no need to use it. The creation of the instrument in itself is expected to deter economic intimidation. Nevertheless, if a third country resorts to coercion in specific cases, the ACI aims to end this coercion. To that end, it allows the EU to formally identify instances of economic coercion, and to respond to individual cases, first through efforts to find a common solution with the coercing country, but in the last resort through reaction. At the same time, the instrument contributes to stronger international coordination to tackle economic coercion by helping to create, develop and clarify international frameworks to prevent and eliminate it.\", \"What exactly does \\u2018economic coercion' mean? In which circumstances can the EU act against those practices?\": \"\\u2018Economic coercion' under the proposal refers to a situation where a third country is seeking to pressure the Union or a Member State into making a particular choice by applying, or threatening to apply, measures affecting trade or investment. Such practices unduly interfere with the legitimate policymaking space of the EU and its Member States and undermine the EU's open strategic autonomy. Whether a third county action fulfils those conditions would be decided on a case-by-case basis. A formal determination will prompt engagement with the coercing country to resolve the issue. The engagement may take the form of direct negotiations and may involve mediation, arbitration, adjudication or others suitable avenues. As a last resort, when the economic coercion persists, the Union may consider taking countermeasures against the country in question in order to counteract such economic coercion. The proposal also makes clear that, throughout the process, the EU should remain open to engage with the coercing country to find a solution.\", \"Can you give an example of coercive practices?\": \"There are many types of coercive practices. For example, an EU trading partner may be seeking to shape future legislative initiatives of the EU or dissuade the EU from introducing a measure altogether by, for example, introducing (or threatening to introduce) extra, discriminatory import duties, intentional delays or refusing (or threatening to refuse) authorisations needed to do business. They might also impose discriminatory selective border or safety checks on goods from a given EU country, or organise state-sponsored boycotts against the goods or investors of that country.\", \"Why is it being proposed now?\": \"Recent rising geopolitical tensions, weakened international cooperation and increasingly weaponised trade and investment have triggered greater recourse to economic coercion. This threatens to undermine the interests of the EU and its Member States. We have seen that economic coercion can come from a variety of countries, and causes broad concern. The European Parliament and several Member States have raised their concerns about the issue of coercion, and asked the Commission last year to develop a mechanism to deter and counter it (see Joint Declaration).\", \"Doesn't the EU have already instruments to prevent such cases?\": \"At the moment, the EU does not have an existing instrument that specifically deals with coercion. The EU needs an appropriate instrument to deter and counteract economic coercion by third countries in order to safeguard its rights and interests and those of its Member States. Without a dedicated instrument, the Union and Member States will fall back on standard diplomatic means, which may not always be sufficiently effective, as they may not exert the necessary deterrent effect. More generally, it is necessary as a signal to international partners that the EU is not willing to accept economic coercion. It highlights the EU's resilience, and would contribute to the EU's open strategic autonomy.\", \"Why is the ACI the right way to deal with economic coercion?\": \"The EU needs to be able to respond to cases of economic coercion in a structured and uniform manner. A dedicated legislative framework ensures predictability and transparency; it underlines the EU's adherence to a rules-based approach, also internationally. Predictability and transparency play a role for the deterrent function of the instrument as well. Procedurally, a legislative framework under the common commercial policy offers possibilities for swift and efficient action where necessary. A legislative framework also serves well the purposes of a platform for international cooperation on the issue of economic coercion.\", \"Does the ACI target a particular country?\": \"No, the ACI would not be targeting any particular country. It is treating the problem of coercion, wherever it may come from. It is designed as a horizontal instrument, applicable to any country using economic coercion against the EU or its Member States.\", \"Which Union response measures are available under the proposed instrument?\": \"The range of potential measures is designed to be broad, in order to allow the selection and design of an effective and efficient response to an individual case of economic coercion that comes up at as small a cost as possible to EU operators. The aim of these measures remains the cessation of the coercion. The proposed ACI lists classical measures related to the fields of goods and services, but also of intellectual property rights and foreign direct investment. Additionally, various restrictions on access to the EU market, such as public procurement, capital, authorisation of products under chemical and sanitary rules, as well as access to EU-funded research programmes. The Communication that accompanies the proposal also recalls other possibilities within the Commission's existing powers, particularly concerning funding, which can also be deployed, if necessary. Such possibilities include, for instance, not engaging in new Union financial commitments for programmes or funds or opposing new financing operations, in accordance with the rules and procedures under the relevant Union financing instruments. Crucially, the EU's response measures are an optional step available only as a last resort and subject to a number of conditions \\u2013 but they can be deployed swiftly, if the need arises. They must be proportionate to the harm they counter, and must be targeted and temporary.\", \"Is the ACI compatible with international law?\": \"The EU policy intervention, in any form, must and will be compatible with both the EU legal order and international law. Countermeasures would be deployed when necessary and in response to a breach of international law by the coercing country. This instrument can only be engaged when the third country adopts a measure of economic coercion and so creates the situation\", \"Does the ACI foresee cooperation with other partners?\": \"Yes, it does. In cases where the ACI would be used, the EU would be able to raise the issue in any relevant international fora, and coordinate with other countries and like-minded partners and allies. The EU is open to discuss with all partners that recognise economic coercion more broadly as an issue. Decision-making under the proposed instrument The Commission proposes the use of traditional implementing and delegated powers available within the common commercial policy area. These offer sufficient flexibility and speed of action. In particular, the Union response measures would be determined and adopted via an implementing act and the Member States assist the Commission in an examination procedure. The Commission proposes that further changes to the menu of potential response measures and rules of origin be done via delegated acts, with the respective involvement of the European Parliament and the Council. Stakeholder involvement is crucial for the selection and design of the Union response measures, notably where such measures may have an impact on specific groups. Relevant stakeholders (such as affected or potentially affected businesses) would have sufficient opportunities to come forward and make their views known and provide information in the concrete application of the instrument. Next steps Following the Commission's proposal with the accompanying impact assessment, the ACI will now follow the ordinary legislative process in the European Parliament and Council for adoption.* In the joint Declaration, the European Parliament and the Council have committed to consider the proposal in a timely manner. Stakeholders and citizens may still provide feedback on the proposal during the following eight weeks. The Commission will report on to the Council and Parliament on the feedback received. Stakeholder feedback so far Earlier this year, the European Commission launched a 12-week public consultation to seek input from businesses, organisations and individuals in shaping the new legal instrument. Stakeholder feedback on the potential instrument has been very positive overall. There is a common recognition by stakeholders that economic coercion is increasingly posing a problem for the EU and its Member States, which should not be left unaddressed. Stakeholders support the creation of a legislative instrument to address the issue of economic coercion. They attach particular value to the function of deterrence, prioritising efforts to encourage third countries to stop the economic coercion through non-interventionist measures (such as diplomacy). They predominantly regard the use of countermeasures as a last resort whose collateral damage must be weighed before action. There is broad support for the rest of the elements as well; the triggers for the use of the instrument should be sufficiently broad to cover informal economic coercion, and, in order to ensure an effective response, the EU should be able to choose from a range of options in individual cases. Stakeholders also greatly value the possibility for international cooperation against economic coercion.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6646\": {\"Why do we need to continue strengthening police cooperation in the EU?\": \"Criminals operate across borders. According to Europol's 2021 EU Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment, almost 70% of criminal networks are active in more than 3 Member States and around 65% of the criminal networks active in the EU are composed of members of multiple nationalities. These criminal networks are involved in major types of cross-border crimes, including trade in drugs, property crime, trafficking in human beings and migrant smuggling. To effectively prevent and detect crimes in the EU, police officers should be able to go after criminals across borders. The current rules on information exchange and police cooperation in the EU have proven not to be sufficiently clear, leading to uncertainty, diverging practices across Member States and practical obstacles to cooperation. Without a good level of cooperation between police forces in Member States, criminals would continue to operate across Member States, taking advantage of the different national jurisdictions. This is why a clearer and coherent legal framework is needed to ensure convergence of national practices and effectiveness of information exchange. Easier police cooperation will help boost the prevention, detection and investigation of criminal offences in the EU, fostering security for everyone living and moving in the Schengen area.\", \"What is the current framework for police cooperation and data exchange? Is it fit for purpose?\": \"The EU has legislation in place on police cooperation and data exchange. The Convention Implementing the Schengen Agreement sets a number of baseline rules for conducting cross-border hot pursuits and cross-border surveillance operations. The rules are however not always precise, allowing for instance Member States to decide on whether or not to set distance limitations when hot pursuits take place on their territory. This creates uncertainty and lack of clarity as to which rules police officers have to follow when intervening in another Member State. The 2006 Council Framework Decision on simplifying the exchange of information between law enforcement authorities sets out rules for information exchange between Member States when conducting criminal investigations or criminal intelligence operations. The Decision has however proven difficult to implement and enforce, meaning rules and practices differ at national level, impeding the efficient flow of information. Operational police cooperation between Member States is also taking place under national law, taking into account non-binding Council guidelines, for instance on setting up contact points for information exchange. Member States have set up at least 60 bilateral and multilateral cooperation agreements between themselves, all different from one another. While this allows Member States to take into account regional specificities, it has also led to fragmentation and obstacles to cooperation. As an example, in smaller or landlocked countries, law enforcement officers may have to follow up to 7 different sets of rules when conducting hot pursuits in neighbouring countries. From a practical point of view, secured communication equipment used between different Member States is also not always compatible, meaning a police officer conducting hot pursuits in another country may not be able to communicate with colleagues from his country or from a neighbouring country once they cross a border. Additionally, Member States do not always have the necessary structures or resources in place to exchange information effectively with other Member States. A single channel for information exchange is missing, leading to duplication of requests, undue delays and occasional information loss. Overall, the level of operational police cooperation between Member States still varies greatly. The current EU legal framework creates uncertainty and lack of clarity as to which rules police officers must follow when intervening in another Member State. The EU also has rules in place for automated exchange under the 2008 Pru\\u0308m framework, allowing police forces of EU Member States to exchange DNA, fingerprints and vehicle registration data for the purpose of preventing, detecting and investigating crime. While the framework has proven to be a successful tool for law enforcement cooperation, helping to solve crimes, several issues hamper the timely and smooth exchange of information. Some of the rules on the technical specifications of queries, security measures and communication are outdated, as forensic science and technology have significantly evolved in the past decade. Differences in national rules and procedures for following up after a \\u201chit\\u201d can also cause significant delays in the information exchange.\", \"What changes does the Commission propose?\": \"Today's proposals will allow police officers across the EU to cooperate more effectively, efficiently and systematically. The proposal for a Council Recommendation on operational police cooperation will make it easier for police officers to work in other EU countries. It will create common standards for better cooperation between police officers participating in joint operations and acting in the territory of another Member State through: Clearer rules for working across borders, with a common list of crimes for which hot pursuits and surveillance across border are possible and no more geographical or time limits on such operations. This also includes clear and common rules on the executive powers police officers can use when engaging in hot pursuits, surveillances and joint operations across borders. Police officers should for instance be able to conduct identity checks during joint operations, or to carry their service weapon and arrest suspects after a hot pursuit, pending the arrival of national police officers.  Effective access to information during cross-border operations: Member States should give police officers operating in other EU countries remote and secure access to their own databases and to EU databases as well as secure messenger tools to communicate directly with their colleagues in the host Member State. Joint planning and risk analysis: Existing police customs cooperation centres should become joint police stations capable of not only exchanging information, but also planning, supporting and coordinating joint operations based on shared risk analysis. Promoting the use of targeted joint operations to counter migrant smuggling and trafficking in human beings. Promoting a common EU culture of policing through joint trainings, including language courses or exchange programmes. The proposal for a Directive on information exchange will ensure police officers make relevant information available to their counterparts in other Member States. The proposal includes: Precise, consistent and common rules to ensure equivalent access to information: If information is available concerning a criminal offence in a Member State, it must, as a general rule, be made available to other Member States' law enforcement authorities as well, under the same conditions. A single contact point and clear time limits: Member States should put in place a \\u201cSingle Point of Contact\\u201d, operational 24/7, adequately staffed and acting as a \\\"one-stop shop\\\" for information exchange with other EU countries. The information requested should be made available within 8 hours (for urgent cases), up to maximum 7 days (in other cases). Requests can only be refused in well-defined cases, for instance if the information would jeopardise the success of an ongoing investigation, harm the vital interest of a person, go against the essential interests of the security of the Member State or if the required judicial authorisation is refused.  A single channel for information exchange: The Secure Information Exchange Network Application (SIENA), managed by Europol, will become the default channel of communication. A stronger role for Europol as the EU criminal information hub: Europol should be in copy of exchanges concerning offences falling under the scope of its mandate. The revised rules on the automated exchange of data under the Pru\\u0308m framework will improve, facilitate and accelerate data exchange through: A simplified channel for exchanging information: Information will go through a central router to which national databases can connect, replacing the multitude of bilateral connections between national databases. The central router will not store any data, it will only act as a message broker. Member States will retain ownership and control over their data. A time limit for efficient information exchange: In case of a match following a query, Member States must share the information identifying the suspect or convicted criminal, including their name, nationality and date of birth, within 24 hours. Additional data categories: Police officers will be able to share facial images of suspects and convicted criminals and police records under the Pru\\u0308m framework (in addition to DNA, fingerprints and vehicle registration data as is already the case currently). Allowing interoperability with other EU information systems, providing for fast and controlled access to the information that law enforcement officers need to perform their tasks and for which they have access rights.  An enhanced role for Europol to support Member States more efficiently by allowing it to take part in the Pru\\u0308m framework. Member States will be able to automatically check biometric data from non-EU countries held at Europol and Europol will be able to check data from non-EU countries against Member States' databases, helping to identify criminals known by countries outside the EU, under the strong privacy and fundamental rights safeguards established in Europol's mandate and in the Europol cooperation agreements with third countries.\", \"How is information exchanged under the \\u2018Pru\\u0308m' framework?\": \"Under the \\u2018Pru\\u0308m' framework, Member States can check whether another EU country holds DNA, fingerprint and vehicle registration data related to an ongoing criminal investigation. For instance, fingerprints found at a crime scene in one EU Member State can be compared with profiles held in the databases of other EU States in an automated manner. If any data matches, the requesting Member State receives a notification. This notification does not include data allowing for the identification of the subject of the match. After the matching data sets are verified by a forensic expert, the requesting Member State can ask to receive more information, including data allowing to identify the person concerned. In case of vehicle registration data, the additional data is provided immediately with a hit.\", \"Why is it necessary to include more categories of data under the automated data exchange in the \\u2018Pru\\u0308m' framework?\": \"The exchange of information on facial images and police records is crucial for effective criminal investigations and for identifying criminals. Adding these categories of data to the automated data exchange under the Pru\\u0308m framework will significantly increase the possibilities of identifying criminals and of solving criminal cases. The exchange of facial images (i.e. photos) and police records between Member States currently takes place manually, with no efficient procedure in place to compare facial images against images stored in other Member States' databases or to find out whether relevant information on police records exists in another Member State's database. In criminal investigations, an image of a suspect (for instance from a nearby security camera) is often the only lead available from the crime scene. Comparing this image not only to images stored in national databases, but also against images stored in other Member States' databases will significantly increase the possibilities of identifying the criminal. It could also reveal different identities used or different crimes committed by the same person in other Member States. Adding facial images of suspects and convicted criminals to the automated data exchange would provide police officers with faster and more reliable access to information, significantly increasing the possibilities of identifying criminals. Similarly, adding police records to the automated data exchange would provide law enforcement authorities with additional information which could contribute to solving criminal cases.\", \"What does the inclusion of facial images entail and what fundamental rights safeguards are proposed?\": \"The image of an unknown person associated with a criminal event (taken for instance from a surveillance camera) will be searched against a law enforcement database containing facial images of known individuals. The search will result in a list of candidates which is then reviewed by a human operator in the requesting Member State, who decides on any potential match. The search can only be made in relation to a specific criminal investigation and after a crime has been committed. Only facial images of suspects or convicted criminals can be exchanged. There will be no matching of facial images to the general population. There is also no envisaged use of artificial intelligence for the comparison of facial images under the proposed Regulation. The results of the search will be returned to the requesting Member State, which will proceed to the verification of these results and to the potential confirmation of a match. Access to data is reserved exclusively for duly authorised staff, on a \\u2018need to know' basis. The Regulation does not propose the establishment of a centralised database for police facial images. It only allows Member States to search facial images of suspects and convicted criminals' on each other's databases. The search is retrospective; the proposal does not entail live facial recognition or remote biometric identification of large groups of persons in public spaces. The addition of facial images will not lead to storing new categories of data as Member States already collect such data under national law and store them in national databases, but will constitute a new processing of data. It would be limited to the extent necessary to achieve its purpose and it would only allow for comparison of data in case-by-case situations. All its provisions are subject to the EU's data protection legislation as set out in the 2016 Law Enforcement Directive. Data identifying the suspect or convicted criminal would only be shared if there is a match following a query.\", \"What role will Europol play under the new rules?\": \"The proposed Directive on information exchange creates an obligation for Member States to involve Europol in information exchange for cases falling under the agency's mandate by using the Europol-managed Secure Information Exchange Network Application (SIENA) as the default channel for communications. As regards operational police cooperation, the proposal for a Council Recommendation asks Member States to create a coordination platform, together with Europol and the Commission, to better support and target joint patrols and other joint operations across the EU. When it comes to automated data exchange, Europol will form an integral part of the Pru\\u0308m framework. Member States will be able to check biometric data from non-EU countries held at Europol. Europol could also check data from non-EU countries against Member States' national databases. This would allow for the potential identification of criminals known by countries outside the EU and guarantee that no gaps occur regarding data related to crime and terrorism received from non-EU countries.\", \"How will data protection and privacy be guaranteed under these proposals?\": \"Today's proposals are subject to the robust data protection rules and procedures set out in the 2016 Law Enforcement Data Protection Directive, helping to ensure full alignment with the EU's personal data protection rules The proposals are based on the principles of data protection by design and by default. Data processing is limited to what is necessary for the purpose of preventing and detecting criminal offences and conducting criminal investigations. Access to data is reserved exclusively for duly authorised staff, on a \\u2018need to know' basis. The Regulation on automated data exchange for police cooperation contains specific provisions on measures required from eu-LISA and Member States' authorities to ensure the security of data processing, the appropriate handling of security incidents, and to guarantee the rights of data subjects. In addition, the use of the Secure Information Exchange Network Application (SIENA) as the default communication channel under the proposed directive on information exchange will also enhance the security of the personal data processing systems and their overall protection against possible abuses. Launched in 2009, SIENA is a trusted platform ensuring secure transmission of sensitive and restricted data, run by Europol.\", \"Is financial support available to Member States to implement the changes proposed?\": \"Financial support is available to Member States under the Internal Security Fund, whose objectives include improving and facilitating information exchange, improving and intensifying cross-border cooperation and supporting the strengthening of Member States' capabilities in preventing and combating crime, terrorism and radicalisation, as well as managing security-related incidents, risks and crises. Member States can therefore include activities relevant for implementing today's proposals in their national programmes.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6609\": {\"Why did the rules governing VAT rates need to be updated?\": \"Current EU rules on VAT rates are almost thirty years old and were in urgent need of modernisation given the evolution of the overall VAT rules over the years. That is why the Commission proposed in 2018 to reform VAT rates. That proposal aimed to fully align VAT rules with the EU's priorities, because in some cases they could even have an adverse effect on progress in these areas. For example, some reduced rates currently allowed under the VAT Directive can have a potentially detrimental effect on the environment. It also aimed to ensure that EU rules encompass certain goods and services linked to technological developments and current public health priorities, to maximise their potential to support positive changes in our society. Today's new rules are supported by a previous agreement to move the EU's VAT system to one where VAT is paid in the Member State of the consumer rather than the Member State of the supplier. This ensures that a greater diversity in rates (as agreed today) would be less likely to disrupt the functioning of the Single Market or to create distortions of competition. At the same time, it also avoids proliferation of reduced rates which would endanger Member States' capacity to collect revenues in the post-COVID-19 era.\", \"What rates will Member States be able to apply to goods on the updated list?\": \"Member States will continue to apply a standard rate of VAT above 15%. However, they will now also have the possibility to apply two reduced rates as low as 5% to goods and services in up to 24 categories included in an updated and modernised Annex III of the VAT Directive. They may also now apply one reduced rate lower than 5% and one exemption (\\u2018zero rate') to a maximum of seven categories on the list considered to cover basic needs e.g. foodstuffs, medicines, pharmaceutical products. Member States have unanimously agreed on this reform. It will ensure a maximum of flexibility while also avoiding the erosion of public revenue: a particularly important safeguard given the huge efforts being undertaken towards a sustainable economic recovery in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and the massive investment needs we face in the coming years in view of the green and digital transitions.\", \"What has been agreed on the list of goods and services that can benefit from reduced rates?\": \"Today's agreement follows intense and diligent consultations between Member States to bring the EU's VAT rates regime into the modern world and align it with EU priorities such as the green and digital transitions, and the protection of public health. As part of this, Member States have agreed to widen the current list of goods and services (Annex III of the VAT Directive) that can benefit from reduced VAT rates. In particular, the list has been updated to include: digital services that previously did not qualify for reduced rates such as internet access and livestreaming of cultural and sports events;goods which protect public health and that have shown to be crucial tools in the fight against COVID-19 and that could prove useful in future crises, such as personal protective equipment, masks and certain medical equipment; as well as more items considered as essential aids for the disabled;certain items such as bicycles, green heating systems and solar panels installed in private homes and public buildings, which can have a positive impact on the EU's climate change priorities;diverse products and services deemed appropriate and useful by Member States, which are driven by the general interest of public policy objectives. The updated list has been compiled according to a number of general principles, to which Member States will need to adhere going forward. These include: equal treatment between Member States, alignment of the list with EU priorities in support of the green and digital transitions, and public health protection, and the exclusion of certain goods and services for which reduced rates are not considered appropriate. Reduced rates for goods and services that were permissible under the previous system but are deemed out of step with the European Green Deal will have to be ended in those Member States that apply them by 2030 at the latest.\", \"What has been decided for derogations and exemptions currently available to individual Member States?\": \"Under the current system, some Member States had been given authorisation upon their accession to the EU to apply derogations such as exemptions and reduced rates to specific items for which such treatment is not normally allowed under Annex III of the VAT Directive. These derogations and exemptions have led to a patchwork of rates across the EU, unequal treatment between Member States able to apply such special measures and those that are not, and represent a possible distortion of competition. As part of today's agreement, existing derogations for Member States that are aligned with the general principles on VAT rates can be kept provided they are in line with the EU Green Deal and pursue public policy objectives, but an \\u2018equal treatment' clause makes them available for other Member States who wish to use them. So-called \\u2018super-reduced rates' which allow stand-alone reduced rates below 5% in some Member States as well as \\u2018parking rates' which allow reduced rates no more than 3 percentage points lower than the standard rate for certain specific products may also be kept under the same conditions. Member States will need to end any derogations that are not in line with the EU's Green Deal by 2030. A number of items that can have a detrimental effect on the environment and, as a consequence, on climate change mitigation action, have been explicitly excluded from Annex III. Member States will have until 2030 to end any favoured treatment for such products. Other existing derogations that are not justified by public policy objectives will need to be ended by 2032.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6596\": {\"How did the Commission assess Spain's first payment request?\": \"On 11 November 2021, Spain submitted to the Commission a request for the disbursement of \\u20ac10 billion under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). The request was based on the achievement of the 52 milestones, as outlined in the Council Implementing Decision, for the first instalment. They cover several reforms in the areas of sustainable mobility, energy efficiency, decarbonisation, connectivity, public administration, skills, education and social, labour and fiscal policy, as well as Spain's audit and control system for the RRF implementation. In line with the RRF Regulation, the Commission had up to two months to carry out its preliminary assessment of the request. However, given that most of the milestones linked to this first payment request had already been achieved by the end of the second quarter of this year, the Commission was able to conclude its assessment more swiftly. With their request, the Spanish authorities provided detailed and comprehensive evidence demonstrating the fulfilment of the 52 milestones included in the Council Implementing Decision assessing the Recovery and Resilience Plan of Spain. The Commission has thoroughly assessed this information before presenting its positive preliminary assessment of the payment request. This will be followed up by detailed discussions with the Member States in the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC) and comitology committee. The submission of the first payment request by Spain followed a period of close cooperation between the Spanish authorities and the Commission on the preparation of the evidence to demonstrate the satisfactory fulfilment of the milestones included in the payment request.\", \"What are the next steps?\": \"The Commission has now sent its positive preliminary assessment of Spain's fulfilment of the milestones required for this payment to the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC), asking for its opinion. The EFC's opinion, to be delivered within maximum four weeks, should be taken into account in the Commission's assessment. The Commission will adopt the final decision on the disbursement of the financial contribution, in accordance with the examination procedure, through a comitology committee. Following the adoption of the decision by the Commission, the disbursement to Spain would take place. The disbursement would subsequently take place following the adoption of the decision by the Commission. The amounts disbursed to the Member States will be published in the Recovery and Resilience Scoreboard.\", \"Why did the Commission not need the full two months envisaged in the Regulation to complete its preliminary assessment?\": \"The positive preliminary assessment of the first payment request by Spain is the result of a thorough evaluation and close cooperation between the Spanish authorities and the Commission. Spain had shared with the Commission most of the information required to conduct the assessment many weeks prior to submitting the formal request. The Commission was therefore able to conduct its assessment in parallel with the negotiation of the operational arrangements. Furthermore, the milestones related to this first payment request were largely backward looking, with most already achieved by the end of the second quarter of this year. In addition, no targets linked to investments were part of this payment request.\", \"How do the milestones achieved by Spain so far effectively support the green transition?\": \"The achieved milestones include an ambitious law on climate change and energy transition, enshrining the renewable energy targets for 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050, including a 100% renewable electricity system by 2050. They also include the approval of strategic documents that will guide further reforms and investments to foster energy efficiency, as well as waste management and the circular economy: the Long-Term Renovation Strategy for Energy Rehabilitation in the Building Sector, the National Strategy for Green Infrastructure, Connectivity and Ecological Restoration and the Spanish Strategy on Circular Economy. Furthermore, the adoption of the law regulating long-term auctions for renewable facilities and the Hydrogen Roadmap will support clean energy sources.\", \"How do the milestones achieved by Spain so far effectively contribute to the digital transition?\": \"A number of the milestones achieved for this payment contribute to supporting the digital transition and will pave the way to an improved level of digital skills of the population, the digital transformation of businesses and digitalisation of the public administration. The milestones reached include the approval of strategic documents that will guide reforms for digital transformation, such as the 2025 Digital Spain Plan, Strategy for the promotion of 5G technology and the National Digital Competences Plan.\", \"How do the milestones achieved by Spain so far contribute to improving Spain's economic and social situation, and its resilience?\": \"The Spanish labour market has suffered from high structural unemployment and from very high levels of temporality already before the pandemic. While employment is slowly regaining its pre-pandemic levels, a number of reforms of the labour market included under the achieved milestones will contribute to supporting quality employment. These include the action plan to tackle youth unemployment and the royal-decree laws on teleworking. They also include measures to prevent and correct the abuse of the reliance on temporary employment in public administration, as well as to reduce the gender gap and to ensure equal pay transparency. Finally, measures to streamline maternity add-ons seek to compensate parents - primarily mothers - for the costs relating to birth and childcare, in order to reduce the gender pension gap. Skills mismatches are also a structural challenge in Spain. The National Digital Competences Plan and the Plan of the Modernisation of Vocational Training will contribute to raising the share of students in science and digital technologies, making vocational education and training more attractive and ensuring flexible upskilling and reskilling opportunities. The reform of the minimum income aims at preventing and fighting poverty and social exclusion, and improving the support provided to families with children. Finally, a significant number of milestones achieved - such as the introduction of taxes on financial transactions and digital services, the appointment of the Committee of experts for tax reform or the set-up of a permanent team in the Ministry of Finance for the active monitoring of the implementation of the results of the spending reviews - will reinforce the economic resilience of the country in the medium term.\", \"Does the achievement of these first milestones contribute to an effective implementation of the Plan?\": \"One of the milestones achieved captures the organisational changes in the central government which aim to foster a lasting improvement in performance-based planning and control in the administration, through the experience in managing the Recovery and Resilience Plan. Two other milestones relate to the arrangements for control and audit, and more generally to the protection of the financial interests of the Union. They include the entry into force of the framework defining the procedures for monitoring the RRP, the format of the information to be shared, as well as the implementation of an IT system that allows for the collection of necessary data for monitoring, controls and audits.\", \"Why did Spain present these 52 milestones for its first payment request?\": \"The milestones and targets to be included in each of the payment requests are set out in the Council Implementing Decision approving the relevant national Recovery and Resilience Plan. In the case of Spain, this Decision provides for the first instalment of the 52 milestones that Spain has now achieved. While the Member States can decide when to submit a payment request for each instalment, they cannot unilaterally amend the number and identity of the milestones in each instalment.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6429\": {\"What is VAT?\": \"Value-Added Tax (VAT) is a consumption tax charged on most goods and services consumed in the EU. The tax is levied on the 'value added' to the product at each stage of production and distribution. This means that VAT is charged when VAT-registered businesses sell to other businesses (B2B) or to the final consumer (B2C). VAT is intended to be 'neutral', in that businesses are able to reclaim any VAT that they pay on goods or services. Ultimately, the final consumer should be the only one who is actually taxed. Businesses are given a VAT identification number and have to show the VAT charged to customers on their invoices. The VAT system in the EU is governed by a common legal framework: the VAT Directive.  Each Member State is responsible for the transposition of these provisions into national legislation and their correct application within its territory. The Commission is responsible for ensuring the correct application of the VAT Directive. Furthermore, VAT contributes not only to national budgets, but is also a source of revenue for the EU budget. It is therefore fundamental to work towards improving VAT collection and reducing the VAT Gap.\", \"What is the VAT Gap?\": \"The VAT Gap is the difference between the expected VAT revenue (or \\u2018VAT Total Tax Liability' - VTTL) and the amount actually collected, in absolute or percentage terms. The VAT Total Tax Liability is an estimated amount of VAT that is theoretically collectable based on VAT legislation and ancillary regulations. This figure represents revenues lost to (1) VAT fraud and evasion, (2) VAT avoidance and optimisation practices, (3) bankruptcies and financial insolvencies, as well as (4) miscalculations and administrative errors. While some revenue losses are impossible to avoid, decisive action and targeted policy responses could make a real difference, particularly when it comes to non-compliance.\", \"What has already been done at EU level to improve the VAT Gap, and what can be done in the future?\": \"VAT fraud results from weaknesses in the current VAT system and the way in which tax administrations manage VAT collection. As VAT is a major revenue source for Member States, VAT losses, including those due to VAT fraud, have a big impact on Member State budgets. The EU has already agreed and begun to implement ambitious rules to increase cooperation and information sharing among Member States and with law enforcement agencies, as well as to tackle specific issues such as VAT fraud in the second-hand car market. Recently introduced EU-wide rules on the collection of VAT on online sales of goods have already started to reap benefits in terms of VAT collection. The EU has supported Member States in working better together in the \\u2018Eurofisc' network, comprised of national officials from the 27 Member States and Norway. Since 2019, they actively use the Transaction Network Analysis (TNA) tool financed by the Union for rapidly exchanging and jointly processing VAT data so that they can automatically detect cross-border VAT fraud at a much earlier stage.  As announced in its 2020 Action Plan for Fair and Efficient Taxation, the Commission also intends to put forward further proposals to modernise the VAT system in the course of 2022. In particular, VAT rules will be updated to ensure that they are fit for the digital age. That said, far-reaching reforms to cut down on VAT fraud in the EU, as proposed in 2017 by the Commission, would help to make the VAT system much more fraud-resilient and easy to use for business, while bringing in much needed revenues for Member States. Today's report also makes the case for further analysis of the VAT Gap by breaking it down into quantifiable amounts for each element that generates losses (i.e. VAT fraud and evasion, tax avoidance, bankruptcies, financial insolvencies and miscalculations). Once assessed and their causes analysed, targeted policies to reduce those losses can be developed.\", \"What are the main findings of the 2021 Report on the VAT Gap?\": \"Relative positive trend continues in 2019: The overall VAT Gap in EU Member States decreased from \\u20ac141 billion in 2018 to \\u20ac134 billion in 2019, 10.3% of the VTTL.  VAT revenue increased by 3.9% whereas the VTTL increased by 3.0%, leading to a decline in the VAT Gap in both relative and nominal terms. While the overall VAT Gap has been improving in recent years, the full extent of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer demand and therefore VAT revenues from 2020 onwards remains unknown. Disparities between Member States remain: In 2019, the estimated VAT Gaps among Member States ranged from 1% in Croatia, to 34.9% in Romania. The smallest Gaps were observed in Croatia (1%), Sweden (1.4%) and Cyprus (2.7%) \\u2013 the largest in Romania (34.9%), Greece (25.8%), and Malta (23.5%). In nominal terms, the largest Gaps were recorded in Italy (\\u20ac30.1 billion), Germany (\\u20ac23.4 billion) and the United Kingdom (\\u20ac17.2 billion). The VAT Gap is due to a number of factors, mainly GDP and government balance: Analysis confirmed that the VAT Gap is influenced by a group of factors relating to the current economic conditions, institutional environment, and economic structure as well as to the measures and actions of tax administrations. GDP growth and general government balance appeared to explain a substantial set of VAT Gap variation. Within the control of tax administrations, share of IT expenditure and the application of additional information obligations for taxpayers proved to have the highest statistical significance in explaining the size of the VAT Gap\", \"What methodology was used to calculate the VAT Gap?\": \"The study derives the expected VAT revenues (VTTL) for each country from national accounts by mapping information on different VAT rates (standard, reduced and exemptions) onto data available on final and intermediate consumption, along with other information provided by Member States. This means that the quality of the VAT Gap estimates depends on the availability, accuracy and completeness of national accounts data. When national accounts figures are reliable, the methodology is precise enough to estimate the VAT Gap. The main limitation of the methodology is the quality of the national accounts: collecting better data and relying less on estimations. Member States use different methodology to estimate the informal economy and to reflect it in their national accounts, thus indirectly affecting the VAT Gap figures.\", \"What causes such differences in the VAT Gap between the Member States?\": \"Variations in the VAT Gap reflect the differences in Member States in terms of the scale of tax compliance, fraud, avoidance, bankruptcies, insolvencies and the performance of the tax administration, among others. The estimates also reflect structural differences in national economies and other variables. Indirect circumstances such as the organisation of national statistics could also have an impact on the size of the VAT Gap.\", \"What is the Policy Gap?\": \"The Policy Gap is an indicator of the additional VAT revenue that a Member State could theoretically collect if it applied a uniform VAT rate on all consumption of goods and services supplied for consideration. The Policy Gap as defined above can in turn be broken down into the Rate Gap and the Exemption Gap. As the terminology suggests, the Rate Gap represents the potential revenue loss due to the existence of reduced rates, whereas the Exemptions Gap represents the potential revenue loss due to the existence of exempted supplies of goods and services. The Exemption Gap, or the average share of \\u2018ideal revenue' lost due to various exemptions is normally the larger of the two and stands at 35% in the EU on average. Countries with the highest Exemption Gap in 2019 were the United Kingdom and Spain (both at 44%), while the lowest value was observed in Malta (17%). In six other countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, and Romania), the Exemption Gap was below 30%. The largest part of Exemption Gap is composed of exemptions on services that cannot be taxed in principle, such as imputed rents, the provision of public goods by the government, or financial services. The remaining level of so-called \\u2018actionable' Exemption Gap is about 6.5% on average. The Rate Gap, on the other hand, ranges from a low of less than 1% in Denmark, to a high of 17% in Cyprus. The average is 9.8%. The results nuance views about the relative importance of reduced rates and exemptions in decreasing the potential VAT revenue, and suggest that better enforcement remains a key component of any strategy to improve the functioning of the VAT system.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6388\": {\"What are the main elements of the proposal?\": \"This initiative aims to modernise EU cross-border judicial cooperation: It proposes digitalising communication between judicial and other authorities in cross-border judicial cooperation procedures in civil (including family), commercial and criminal matters.In addition, it gives individuals and businesses the option to communicate with judicial and other authorities through electronic means in cross-border cases.It will ensure electronic communication from individuals, businesses and legal practitioners are accepted, and have legal certainty \\u2013 namely through the compulsory recognition of electronic signatures and seals and the legal admissibility of electronic documents.In cross-border cases, the proposal will make it possible to conduct oral hearings in civil and criminal procedures through videoconferencing.Parties to civil and commercial cases with cross-border implications will be able to pay court fees electronically. It will modernise Eurojust's information system. It will integrate in it the European Judicial Counter Terrorism Register and its functionalities, in order to improve the capacities of link identification.It will set-up secure digital communication channels between national authorities and Eurojust.It will introduce a digital communication tool to facilitate digital exchange of structured data and to automate processes.It will introduce a clear legal basis in the Eurojust Regulation for cooperation with non-EU liaison prosecutors. Establish a Joint Investigation Teams collaboration platform - The platform will be a highly secure online collaboration tool aiming to facilitate exchanges and cooperation within JITs throughout their duration.Provide technological support to those involved in JITs to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of cross-border investigations and prosecutions conducted by them.Ensure that those involved in JITs can more easily share information and evidence collected in the course of the JIT activities, by enabling them to more easily and more safely communicate with each other, and by facilitating the joint daily management of a JIT.\", \"How will this initiative improve the way in which authorities communicate?\": \"The proposal establishes a dedicated and secure decentralised IT system. This system will be composed of the IT systems of the Member States and of Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) agencies and bodies, which will be interconnected through interoperable access points (based on the e-CODEX system). Where Member States do not have existing national IT systems, they will have the choice to use, free of charge, a Commission-developed reference implementation solution. Alternative means of communication between authorities will be allowed only in case of disruption of the system, or in other specific circumstances where the use of the decentralised IT system is not appropriate.\", \"How will the proposal benefit individuals and businesses involved in EU cross-border judicial procedures?\": \"To ensure smooth access to courts or other judicial authorities, individuals, businesses and legal practitioners will be able to use electronic means of communication to file claims and otherwise communicate with the authorities in EU cross-border civil law cases (for instance, under the European Small Claims procedure). Where national IT portals for electronic communication in EU civil law matters exist, they can continue to be used. In parallel, the Commission will develop a European access point hosted on the European e-justice Portal. Each person will be able to log in, create an account and file all types of submissions, claims, requests, and standardised forms, both to national judicial authorities and to those of other Member States. The use of the European access point will be free of charge. Individuals, businesses and legal practitioners will not be obliged to use electronic means of communication with courts and authorities, and may continue to use paper or other types of traditional communication.\", \"What will the cost for Member States for implementing the IT systems be?\": \"Member States will have to bear the cost related to the decentralised IT system. The Commission will provide funding opportunities to support Member States in setting up the necessary infrastructure, if needed. The Commission expects that the \\u201caccess points\\u201d of the decentralised IT system will be based on e-CODEX that can be used free of charge. However, national IT systems need to be developed so that they may be connected through e-CODEX. The Commission will finance creation, maintenance and future development of a software, which Member States may decide to use instead of developing national IT systems.\", \"How will personal data be protected?\": \"The digitalisation of existing data exchanges will not introduce any new personal data categories compared to what is already exchanged today, nor will it affect the existing data processing arrangements. The security of personal data processing is essential to protect data subjects. e-CODEX was designed specifically for the justice area, and uses encryption to ensure security. Using e-CODEX for cross-border exchanges will increase security and thereby mitigate the risk of security breaches. e-CODEX is therefore clearly an improvement compared to present exchanges using paper or unsecure e-mails. Digital information in cross-border terrorism cases In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the Bataclan concert hall in Paris 2015, the necessity to identify links between and coordinate cross-border terrorist investigations and prosecutions early on became evident. Learning from this experience, Eurojust established the European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register to reinforce the judicial response in Member States to terrorist threats and to improve security for citizens. However, the data processing environment at Eurojust is outdated and exchange of information with national competent authorities is not structurally digitalised. This makes information exchange cumbersome, leading to suboptimal results in the exchange of information. The platform itself will not change nor will the underlying legal frameworks for conducting a JIT and as such the already existing obligation of Member States to comply with data protection rules for the exchange of personal data. The platform is a secure and reliable technical addition to allow for a better, swifter and safer way of conducting these communications and exchanges. Additionally, the JIT collaboration platform will fully comply with the EU data legislation.\", \"What exactly is the European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register?\": \"The European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register is a unique EU-wide database for judicial proceedings relating to terrorist offences. The authorities of the Member States provide information on these cases to Eurojust where it is cross-checked with information on other cases relating to terrorism, but also relating to other cases of serious crime. Once a potential link \\u2013 such as the same or similar name of a suspect \\u2013 is established, the National Members at Eurojust follow up to see if this potential link can be validated. Once it is clear that a link exists, Eurojust informs the national authorities involved in the case. Eurojust also provides further support to such investigations.\", \"How will the proposal improve the European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register?\": \"Digitalising data exchange will enable national authorities to send more information to Eurojust. It will be quick and secure. At Eurojust, the new information management system will identify many links automatically and require much less manual intervention to identify links. Thereby Eurojust will be able to give faster and better feedback to national authorities and support them in the follow-up. This will enable the national authorities to have a better understanding of the full extent of the criminal activities, to prosecute terrorist offences and serious cross-border crimes more efficiently and not stop the investigations at their own Member State's borders.\", \"How will the proposal benefit the general public?\": \"The European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register and the follow-up through judicial cooperation in criminal matters is essential to effectively combat terrorism and thus ensure security of citizens across the EU. The European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register may also contribute to respecting fundamental rights; the communication and cooperation of national judicial authorities may reveal links between cases and therefore prevent multiple prosecutions and convictions of transnational crimes. Thus, it will ensure the right not to be tried or punished twice in criminal proceedings for the same criminal offence (Article 50 Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union). Joint Investigation Teams (JITs) collaboration platform Joint Investigation Teams (JITs) are set up by two or more States for specific criminal investigations with a cross border impact and for a limited period of time. This framework allows the competent judicial and law enforcement authorities involved to organise and coordinate their actions jointly and investigate efficiently even in very complex cases such as organised crime activities not bound by any borders. Although JITs have proven to be one of the most successful tools for cross-border investigations and prosecutions in the EU, practice shows they have been facing several technical difficulties preventing them from gaining the highest possible efficiency. The main difficulties concern secure electronic exchange of information and evidence (including large files), secure electronic communication with other JIT members and JIT participants, such as Eurojust, Europol and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), as well as a joint daily management of a JIT. The JIT collaboration platform will solve these problems and deliver the technical support that has been missing so far.\", \"What will the key functionalities of the platform be?\": \"Allow secure non-traceable communication to be stored locally on the devices of the users, including a communication tool offering an instant messaging system, a chat feature, audio/video-conferencing and a functionality replacing regular emails.Allow the exchange of operational information and evidence, including large files, through an upload/download system designed to store the data centrally only for a limited period of time necessary for a technical transfer of the data. As soon as all addresses downloaded the data, the data will be automatically deleted from the platform.Allow evidence traceability \\u2013 an advanced logging mechanism allowing to keep a trace of who did what and when regarding all evidence exchanged through the platform, and, consequently, supporting the need to ensure admissibility of evidence in front of a court.\", \"What will the cost of the platform be?\": \"The Regulation establishing the platform is envisaged to incur the following costs: Development of the platform \\u2013 the one-off cost incurred for eu-LISA \\u2013 around \\u20ac10 million.Technical maintenance and operation of the platform \\u2013 the recurring cost incurred for eu-LISA \\u2013 around \\u20ac3 million per year. For Member States, no technical costs are considered because the centralised component of the platform is web-based. It will not require any adaptions of the national technical infrastructure. The same pertains to the communication software, which will simply need to be downloaded on each device of the JIT platform's users. Access to the platform for the competent Union bodies, offices and agencies, such as Eurojust, Europol the EPPO and OLAF, will be driven by the same principles and will not incur any costs.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6434\": {\"Why is this Communication proposed now?\": \"The COVID-19 pandemic has harshly exposed the impact of today's incomplete, incompatible or disconnected global infrastructure. The lack of digital connections, the disruption to supply chains and the scarcity of medical goods has tremendous human and economic consequences. Furthermore, the increasingly complex global landscape has highlighted the EU's vital interest to ensure that global connections and networks develop in line with democratic values and high standards, ensuring a level playing field, while at the same time supporting sustainable development in our partner countries, fully in line with the UN's 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement. Global Gateway takes an ethical approach so that infrastructure projects do not create unsustainable debt. According to G20 estimates, the global infrastructure investment deficit will reach \\u20ac13 trillion by 2040. Bridging the world's infrastructure gap and achieving the infrastructure-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in partner countries, while staying on track to limit climate change and environmental degradation will require an estimated investment of \\u20ac1.3 trillion per year. In this context, the Foreign Affairs Council of 12th July 2021 requested the Commission and the High Representative to prepare an EU global connectivity strategy. With Global Gateway, the EU, in a Team Europe approach, will offer its partners a response to the urgent needs to develop sustainable and high quality digital, climate and energy and transport infrastructures and strengthen health, education and research systems across the world, taking into account their needs and the EU's own interests. We will invest in projects that can be delivered with high standards, good governance, transparency, while ensuring financial sustainability at the same time.\", \"What is new in this Communication and how does it relate to previous initiatives in Connectivity?\": \"Global Gateway is global in scope, adapting to the needs and strategic interests of different regions. It builds on the achievements of the 2018 EU-Asia Connectivity Strategy, the recently concluded Connectivity Partnerships with Japan and India, as well as the Economic and Investment Plans for the Western Balkans, the Eastern Partnership, and the Southern Neighbourhood, but paying also particular attention to Africa, Central Asia and Latin America. Global Gateway will be implemented in a Team Europe approach, that brings together funding by the EU, its Member States and European financial institutions, ensuring that investments can be targeted and more effective, strengthening existing initiatives and fostering new ones. Global Gateway is values driven and based on the Union's high social, environmental, fiscal and labour standards. It will focus on physical infrastructure \\u2013 such as fibre optic cables, transport corridors, clean power transmission lines - to strengthen digital, transport and energy networks. It will also provide an enabling environment to make sure projects deliver, by offering attractive investment and business-friendly trading conditions, regulatory convergence, standardisation, supply chain integration and financial services. The EU has put in place financial and other tools to address the investment needs in sustainable infrastructure development across the world. In terms of new financial tools, the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI-Global Europe), adopted in June 2021, has an overall budget of \\u20ac79 billion, and a number of tools to enable the EU to leverage our investments, in particular the European Fund for Sustainable Development plus (EFSD+). In addition, the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) III (with an overall budget of over \\u20ac14 billion) , as well as Interreg, InvestEU and the EU research and innovation programme Horizon Europe, will allow the EU to leverage public and private investments in priority areas, including connectivity.\", \"Is Global Gateway a response to the Chinese Belt and Road initiative and how does it relate to others?\": \"We are living a key moment in our history. The challenges of the post-Covid recovery need to be addressed in the context of the post-COP26 consensus on sustainability. Low and middle-income countries face a significant infrastructure-financing gap \\u2013 the World Bank estimated it at over USD 2.7 trillion in 2019, and the Covid-19 crisis has worsened since. More and better development finance from all donors is crucial for advancing the implementation of SDGs in partner countries. By offering an innovative choice for global infrastructure development, based on the needs of our partners, Global Gateway will be an investment in international stability and cooperation. Global Gateway can demonstrate how democratic values provide certainty and transparency for investors, sustainability for partners and long-term benefits for people around the world. The EU will offer its financing under fair and favourable terms in order to limit the risk of debt distress. We want to deliver mutual benefits through quality infrastructure, based on our values and principles, that work for people and planet, whilst also defending our interests and strengthening the rules-based world. With Global Gateway, Europe will play its full part in narrowing the global investment gap. But meeting this objective will require the concerted effort of like-minded partners and support work started within the G7. Initiatives such as the Build Back Better World and Global Gateway will mutually reinforce each other. This commitment to working together was reaffirmed at COP26, the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, where the EU and the United States brought together like-minded partners to express their shared commitment to addressing climate crisis through the development of infrastructure that is clean, resilient, and consistent with a net-zero future.\", \"What is Global Gateway's approach and how will it support Human Rights in the world?\": \"The EU's external action contributes to the promotion of its values and principles and is rooted in the respect for democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as the rule of law. Global Gateway will channel EU spending on global infrastructure development in accordance with the following key principles: Democratic values and high standards Global Gateway will offer a values-based option for partner countries to choose from when deciding how to meet their infrastructure development needs. This means adhering to the rule of law, upholding high standards of human, social, and workers' rights and respecting norms from international rules to intellectual property and open public procurement. It means selecting investments that are sustainable \\u2013 for local people, local environment and local economies. It means taking an ethical approach so that infrastructure projects do not create unsustainable debt or unwanted dependencies. Good Governance and Transparency Delivering projects that work for people will require transparency, accountability and financial sustainability. It will need open access to public procurement and a level playing field for potential investors and a clear set of agreed deliverables to ensure that Global Gateway projects say what they will deliver - and deliver what they promise. Those most affected by potential projects \\u2013 local communities, businesses and partners \\u2013 must have their full say through proper public consultations and civil society involvement. Projects should ensure affordable and equal access to the services and benefits they will deliver, notably for women and girls and those at risk of disadvantage or exclusion. Equal partnerships Global Gateway projects will be designed, developed and implemented in close cooperation and consultation with partner countries. Infrastructure projects will be based on the needs and opportunities that they identify for their local economies and local communities, as well as the EU's own strategic interests. This means developing partnerships with countries at eyes-level and ensuring that project planning takes into account the capacity of host countries to manage and maintain the infrastructure in a sustainable way after it has been completed. Green and clean The Global Gateway is a climate-neutral strategy to speed up sustainable development and recovery, create inclusive growth and jobs and transition to a cleaner and more circular global economy. It will invest in developing infrastructures that are clean, climate-resilient and aligned with pathways towards net zero emissions. Projects will live up to the European Green Deal oath to \\u2018do no harm' and ensure the use of environmental impact assessments and strategic environmental assessments. Security-focused Secure infrastructure underpins the resilience of global economy and supply chains\\u2013 be it on digital, health, transport or energy. Global Gateway projects will invest in infrastructure to plug vulnerabilities, provide trusted connectivity and build capacity in the face of natural or man-made challenges, physical, cyber or hybrid threats, and economic coercion for geopolitical aims. They will ensure that citizens are shielded from unwarranted surveillance by public authorities or private companies. Catalysing private sector investment Europe's world-leading industry, private sector knowledge and investment capacity gives us a unique competitive advantage around the world and Global Gateway must make full use of it in order to be a viable and attractive alternative for partner countries. The Global Gateway will combine and leverage resources from the EU, its Member States, financial institutions and Multilateral Public Finance, and use these public resources to crowd-in private capital.\", \"What are the key sector for investments priorities under Global Gateway?\": \"Global Gateway will strengthen the people-to-people connections between Europe and its partners and will channel its investments where infrastructure gaps have been exposed or exacerbated in recent years in digital, climate and energy, transport, health and education and research. A digital transition in line with European values and standards The EU will work with partner countries to deploy digital networks and infrastructures such as submarine and terrestrial fibre-optic cables, space-based secure communication systems as well as cloud and data infrastructures, which together provide a basis for exchanges of data, cooperation in high performance computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and earth observation. We will prioritise underserved regions, countries and populations, with the aim of tackling the global digital divide and strengthening secure digital connections within them and between Europe and the world. The EU will minimize the environmental footprint of digital infrastructure, by promoting green data centres and deploying underwater cables equipped with ocean monitoring sensors. Energy connectivity in support of the green transition EU will invest in infrastructure and supporting regulation to pave the way for the clean energy transition in partner countries. Together they provide a unique opportunity to transform economies, create employment and strengthen energy security. We will cooperate with partner countries to enable their just energy transition and to diversify our clean energy supply at the same time. The EU will support regional energy integration, promote energy efficiency, renewable energy (including smart grids) and just transition. We will work with partner countries that have the potential to develop their renewable hydrogen production, and promote the creation of competitive markets to enable such hydrogen produced outside the EU to be traded internationally without export restrictions or price distortions. The EU will also work with partner countries to invest in infrastructure for developing sustainable and resilient raw materials value chains. Sustainable, smart, resilient, inclusive and safe transport networks Global Gateway will promote worldwide infrastructure investments that create sustainable, smart, resilient, inclusive, and safe transport networks in all modes of transport, including rail, road, ports, airports, as well as logistics, and border-crossing points, in a multimodal system. We will implement transport infrastructure projects that foster the sustainable development of partner countries and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as enable the diversification of their supply chains. We will also seek to build on our position as the world's transportation hub. Health Global Gateway will prioritise the security of supply chains and the development of local manufacturing. As regards the security of supply chains, the EU will be working with partner countries to diversify their pharmaceutical supply chains. The Health and Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) will also contribute to addressing international supply chain bottlenecks and establish close collaboration with global partners to prevent future health emergencies and strengthen global surveillance. Education and research The EU will invest in quality education, including digital education and work with partner countries to strengthen cooperation on research and innovation. Through education, training, youth and sport exchange programmes, the EU facilitates mobility of students and staff and strengthens higher education institutions and peer learning. The Erasmus+ strengthens societal links and promotes the EU's soft power and the attractiveness of its model of society. Talent Partnerships will facilitate the mobility of partner countries' young professionals and trainees to Europe for employment or training. The EU also seeks to reinforce global co-operation in the field of research and innovation. As reflected in the EU's Strategy on international cooperation on research and innovation \\u2018the \\u2018Global Approach'[1], the EU is a major catalyst to increase scientific excellence and addressing global challenges while enhancing economic growth and job creation. The Horizon Europe Programme includes opportunities for collaborative research and for mobility of researchers at international, inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary level. Horizon Europe also now offers the possibility to associate countries located anywhere in the world, which share fundamental values and with a strong science, technology and innovation profile. The EU will also continue investing in cultural cooperation between Europeans and citizens in partner countries.\", \"How will Global Gateway be financed?\": \"Global Gateway will be implemented through a Team Europe approach to scale up resources from the EU Institutions, Member States with their financial and development institutions, the European Investment Bank (EIB), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). It will actively seek to mobilise private sector finance and expertise and support access to sustainable finance. Using all of the financial and development tools at the EU's disposal and supported by the strong commitment from EU Member States, Global Gateway aims to mobilise up to \\u20ac300 billion between 2021 and 2027. Under NDICI-Global Europe, with an overall budget of \\u20ac79 billion, investments in building connections are expected to rise significantly. It has a 35% spending target for climate actions and an additional 10% approximately of the total funding will be dedicated to digital actions. NDICI-Global Europe establishes the new European Fund for Sustainable Development Plus (EFSD+) as its financial arm, backed by the Union's External Action Guarantee (EAG),of \\u20ac40billion (out of a total of \\u20ac53.4 billion) to de-risk investments and leverage private investments, working together with the EIB and other European financial institutions, as well as EU. Member States' institutions (development banks, national promotional banks, export credit agencies) and capital from the private sector. The EU can also leverage private investments by means of its Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) III, Interreg, InvestEU and the EU research and innovation programme Horizon Europe. The EFSD+ will make available up to \\u20ac135 billion in investments guaranteed by the External Action Guarantee for Global Gateway projects, in addition to up to \\u20ac18 billion in grants and a further planned \\u20ac145 billion in investment volumes by European financial and development financial institutions. Financing will rely on systematic mechanisms to filter out abnormally low tenders, and foreign subsidies that undermine the level playing field. The EU is also exploring the possibility of establishing a European Export Credit Facility to complement the existing export credit arrangements at Member State level and increase the EU's overall firepower in this area. The Facility would help ensure a more level playing field for EU businesses in third country markets, where they increasingly have to compete with foreign competitors that receive large support from their governments, and thus facilitate their participation in infrastructure projects.\", \"How will the European Fund for Sustainable Development+ (EFSD+) be used concretely?\": \"In partnership with the European Investment Bank (EIB), the EU will provide a total \\u20ac26.7 billion guarantee to cover investments in several sectors such as clean energy, green infrastructure and health The risk coverage provided will allow the EIB to offer loans to partner countries to make sustainable investments in connectivity and other priority sectors. As one of the sectoral windows of the EFSD+ that is open to all development financial institutions under the Open Architecture concept (\\u20ac13 billion), the Commission will propose a specific Global Gateway y window, which will, together with other thematic windows such as the Sustainable Finance window, focus on sectors such as sustainable energy, clean transport and digital. A dedicated sub-window will be created for digital connectivity with a country level approach to reinforce convergence with the EU's digital economy packages. Where projects have a public added value, which is not monetarised and that guarantees cannot address, the EU will use the EFSD+ blending facilities. These facilities offer grants to financial institutions to give loans to EU partner countries for affordable investment projects, while enhancing their sustainability, climate-proofing and development impact.\", \"Who will decide the projects selected and when can we expect that the first projects take off?\": \"The proposal for Global Gateway is underpinned by the start of implementation of the EU multi-annual financial framework 2021-2027 and the use of its new financial tools. The projects under Global Gateway will continue to be decided in line with the respective governance mechanisms of their respective financing instruments, while a Global Gateway Board* to give strategic guidance will be established focused on its implementation, including the development of Team Europe Initiatives. The EU's Delegations around the world will play a key role to identify and coordinate Global Gateway projects in partner countries.\", \"How will you work with the private sector and civil society?\": \"Global Gateway projects will be developed and delivered through Team Europe Initiatives. The EU institutions, Member States, and European financial institutions will work together with European businesses as well as governments, civil society and the private sector in partner countries. The Commission will set up a Business Advisory Group on the Global Gateway to discuss the implementation of the Global Gateway strategy, ensuring private sector involvement. A dialogue will also be set up with civil society to ensure a fully inclusive approach is taken. How much money did the EU invest in the last period in connectivity In the years between 2014 and 2020, the EU invested 14% of its external budget \\u2013 \\u20ac9.62 billion \\u2013 on connectivity projects. Under the 2021-2027 budget cycle, this sum will likely increase significantly, thanks to a larger external budget and increased spending in the priority areas digital, energy and climate, transport, health and education and research. *Updated on 6 december 10:00 [1] Communication \\u2018Global Approach to Research and Innovation', COM(2021) 252 final\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6281\": {\"Why was this proposal adopted?\": \"Since June 2021, vaccine uptake has increased significantly and the rollout of the EU Digital COVID Certificate has progressed at a rapid pace, with more than 650 million certificates having been issued. As a result, the EU Digital COVID Certificate is a widely available and reliably accepted tool to facilitate free movement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Almost all Member States also use the EU Digital COVID Certificate for domestic purposes. At the same time, the epidemiological situation within the EU, characterised by a high and increasing overall case notification rate, remains challenging. In view of these developments, the Commission proposes to adapt the common approach set out in Council Recommendation (EU) 2020/1475. In particular, a person's COVID-19 vaccination, test or recovery status, as evidenced by an EU Digital COVID Certificate, should be the key determinant. As EU Digital COVID Certificates can be safely issued, verified and accepted, the Commission proposes that persons travelling within the EU who are in the possession of a valid EU Digital COVID Certificate should in principle not be subject to additional restrictions to free movement, such as further tests for COVID-19 infection or quarantine. To avoid diverging measures across the EU, the Commission also proposes, for the purpose of travel, a validity period of 9 months for vaccination certificates since the completion of the primary vaccination series. This takes into account the guidance of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) regarding the administration of booster doses as of 6 months, and provides for an additional period of 3 months to ensure that national vaccination campaigns can adjust and citizens can have access to boosters. To ensure a coordinated approach, Member States should not accept such vaccination certificates if more than 9 months have passed since the date of vaccination indicated. At this stage, the Commission does not propose a validity period for certificates issued based on booster shots. In addition, the Commission proposes to adapt the traffic light map published weekly by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, in order to take into account the effects of increased vaccination. Other parts of the proposal concern the coordination of measures in response to the emergence of possible new coronavirus variants or other serious epidemiological situations. As the proposal will need to be discussed in and adopted by the Council, the proposed recommendations are still subject to change.\", \"What are the main changes in the new Recommendation as proposed by the Commission?\": \"The key updates, proposed by the Commission, are: Focus on a \\u2018person-based approach': a person in possession of a valid EU Digital COVID Certificate should in principle not be subject to additional restrictions, such as tests or quarantine, regardless of their place of departure in the EU. Persons without an EU Digital COVID Certificate could be asked for a test carried out prior to or after arrival.Standard validity of vaccination certificates: To avoid diverging and disruptive approaches, the Commission proposes a standard acceptance period of 9 months for vaccination certificates issued after the completion of the primary vaccination series. This means that, in the context of travel, Member States should not refuse a vaccination certificate that has been issued less than 9 months since the administration of the last dose of the primary vaccination. Member States should immediately take all necessary steps to ensure access to vaccination for those population groups whose previously issued vaccination certificates approach the 9-month limit.Booster shots: As of yet, there are no studies expressly addressing the effectiveness of boosters on transmission of COVID-19 and therefore it is not possible to determine an acceptance period for boosters. However, given the emerging data, it can reasonably be expected that protection from booster vaccinations may last longer than that resulting from the primary series. The Commission will closely monitor newly emerging scientific evidence on this issue. On the basis of such evidence, the Commission may, if needed, propose an appropriate acceptance period also for vaccination certificates issued following a booster. The EU traffic light map is adapted, combining new cases (incidence rate) with a region's vaccine uptake and a testing rate. The map would be mainly for information, but would also serve to coordinate measures for areas with particularly low (\\u2018green') or particularly high level (\\u2018dark red') of circulation of the virus. For these areas, specific rules would apply by derogation from the \\u2018persons-based approach'. For travel from \\u2018green' areas, that would mean that no restrictions should be applied. Travel to and from \\u2018dark red' areas should be discouraged, given the high number of new infections there, and persons who are neither vaccinated nor have recovered from the virus should be required to test prior to departure and quarantine after arrival (with special rules for essential travellers and children).Exemptions from certain travel restrictions: should apply to cross-border commuters, children under 12 and essential travellers. The list of essential travellers should be reduced, as many travellers included in the current list have had the opportunity to be vaccinated in the meantime.Simplified \\u2018emergency brake' procedure: the emergency procedure intended to delay the spread of possible new COVID-19 variants or address particularly serious situations should be simplified and more operational. It would include a Member State notification to the Commission and the Council and a roundtable at the Council's Integrated Political Crisis Response (IPCR).\", \"What are the criteria used by ECDC to mark a region in the different colours?\": \"Taking into account the progress in terms of vaccine uptake, the Commission proposes to adapt the criteria and thresholds used for the traffic light map. The criterion of new cases should be weighted by the vaccine uptake in the same region, to take into account that vaccination reduces the risk of transmitting COVID-19. The testing rate constitutes a third criterion. The resulting weighted rate should be assigned a colour-code using the thresholds of the risk assessment model developed by ECDC. The colours of the current map, \\u2018green', \\u2018orange', \\u2018red' and \\u2018dark red' would be maintained. Regions with an insufficient testing rate would be shown in \\u2018dark grey', and those with insufficient data in \\u2018grey'. The details of the adapted traffic light map are set out in the Annex to the Commission's proposal.\", \"What is an \\u2018emergency brake' and when can it be used?\": \"The \\u2018emergency brake' procedure is intended to allow for a coordinated response to the emergence of new coronavirus variants assessed as \\u2018of concern' or \\u2018of interest' (more information here). In addition, it is intended to provide for a coordinated response to case where the epidemiological situation worsens quickly, in particular in areas already classified as \\u2018dark red'. According to the Commission's proposal, this procedure could be triggered either by a Member State or the Commission. This would then result in a roundtable of the Council's integrated political crisis response mechanism being called, where the Member State or the Commission could outline why the procedure was triggered. Based on a proposal by the Commission, the roundtable could conclude that certain coordinated measures should be taken by Member States, in particular to delay the spread of a new variant.\", \"Can EU Member States refuse entry to people travelling from another EU Member State?\": \"Member States should always admit their own nationals and EU citizens and their family members who reside in their territory. In addition, Member States should in principle not refuse the entry of other persons travelling from other Member States, and should facilitate swift transit through their territories. Any restrictions to the fundamental right to free movement of persons within the EU must be applied in compliance with the general principles of EU law, in particular proportionality and non-discrimination. Any measures taken should thus not extend beyond what is strictly necessary to safeguard public health. Only very exceptional situations, such as the emergency of a new variant of concern, could thus justify denying entry to EU citizens who do not reside in the Member State concerned.\", \"Can booster doses be included in the EU Digital COVID Certificate?\": \"Most Member States have already announced or have already started to administer COVID-19 vaccine booster doses. An EU Digital COVID Certificate must be issued after the administration of each dose. This means that Member States must also issue a vaccination certificate in the EU Digital COVID Certificate format after the administration of an additional dose. On 17 November 2021, the Commission adopted standard rules on how to encode a booster dose in the EU Digital COVID Certificate: a booster following a two-dose vaccine will be reflected as \\u201c3/3\\u201d in the certificate and a booster following a single-dose vaccine will be reflected as \\u201c2/2\\u201d.\", \"What about the validity of vaccination certificates?\": \"Over 65% of the EU population is today better protected from falling seriously ill and dying from COVID-19 as a result of the currently available COVID-19 vaccines, which offer protection against severe disease, loss of life and long-term consequences from infection. However, linked to the emerging evidence that the protection from infection with COVID-19 resulting from vaccination appears to decrease over time, several Member States have also adopted rules on how long a vaccination certificate should be accepted. To ensure a coordinated approach, the Commission proposes a standard acceptance period for vaccination certificates of 9 months issued after the completion of the primary vaccination series. This takes into account the guidance of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control regarding the administration of booster doses as of 6 months, and provides for an additional period of 3 months to ensure that national vaccination campaigns can adjust and citizens can have access to boosters. To ensure a coordinated approach, Member States should not accept such vaccination certificates if more than 9 months have passed since the date of vaccination. At this stage, the Commission does not propose a validity period for certificates issued based on booster shots. This means that the 9-month validity period should not apply to certificates issued following booster shots. It can reasonably be expected that protection from booster vaccinations may last longer than that resulting from the primary vaccination series. The Commission will closely monitor newly emerging scientific evidence on this issue. On this basis, the Commission may, at a later stage, propose if necessary to use a validity period also for vaccination certificates issued following a booster.\", \"The Commission proposes for the updates to the Recommendation apply as of 10 January 2022. Does it mean that the new validity rules, if agreed by the Council, would also apply as of that date?\": \"To allow for sufficient time for the coordinated approach to be implemented, the Commission is indeed proposing that the updates to the common approach, including on the validity of vaccination certificates, should apply as of 10 January 2022. For example, a vaccination certificate that indicates, as the date of vaccination with the second dose of a two-dose primary vaccination series, 15 May 2021 should be accepted until 15 February 2022. After that date, the holder can either travel on the basis of the vaccination certificate issued following the booster shot (which would currently not be subject to a validity period at this stage) or on the basis of a test certificate. A vaccination certificate which indicates, as the date of vaccination with the second dose of a two-dose primary vaccination series, 15 February 2021 should not be accepted when the validity rules start to apply on 10 January 2022 (as the 9 months already lapsed on 15 November 2021). As of 10 January 2022, the holder can travel on the basis of a test certificate. Member States should immediately take all necessary steps to ensure access to vaccination for those population groups whose previously issued vaccination certificates approach the limit of 9 months\", \"What happens if I do not have the EU Digital COVID Certificate yet?\": \"The EU Digital COVID Certificate Regulation states that possession of an EU Digital COVID Certificate must not be a precondition for exercising the right to free movement. To ensure this, the Commission proposes that persons not in the possession of an EU Digital COVID Certificate should not be prevented from travelling, but could be required to undergo a test for COVID-19 infection prior to or after arrival to reduce the risk of imported infections. In addition, they might be required to undergo quarantine/self-isolation when they arrive from particularly affected areas (dark red).\", \"Does the proposal provide for exemptions for essential travellers or other groups particularly affected by travel restrictions?\": \"The Commission proposes to maintain a list of categories that should be exempt from the need to have an EU Digital COVID Certificate when travelling. This list is the following: transport workers or transport service providers, including drivers and crew of freight vehicles;patients travelling for imperative medical reasons;seafarers; andpersons living in border regions and travelling across the border on a daily or frequent basis for the purposes of work, business, education, family, medical care or caregiving. The Commission proposes to shorten the list currently applicable, given that many essential travellers have had the opportunity to be vaccinated in the meantime. In addition, transport workers and transport service providers should also not be required to have a test or to undergo quarantine when travelling from \\u2018dark red' areas, given the impact of requirements on the internal market. Even if the emergency brake is triggered, transport workers and transport service providers should only be required to undergo rapid antigen tests, if needed.\", \"Are there any specific rules for children travelling within the EU?\": \"The Commission proposes that Member States agree on the following rules regarding children travelling within the EU: children below the age of 12 should not be required to be in the possession of an EU Digital COVID Certificate or a negative test when travelling from areas other than \\u2018dark red' ones;children from 6 to 12 arriving from \\u2018dark red' areas should be in the possession of an EU Digital COVID Certificate or a negative test;children below the age of 6 arriving from \\u2018dark red' areas should be exempt from the requirement to undergo travel-related tests for COVID-19 infection.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6252\": {\"Why is the Commission proposing this?\": \"In order to make sound investment decisions, investors in capital markets need information about the companies they are interested in, ideally in a digital format. Companies are required to publish financial and sustainability-related information under EU law. But today, access to this information is scattered across Member States and is not very digitally useable. The ESAP will improve this situation, by giving easy digital access to companies' financial and sustainability-related information, as well as on investment products.\", \"How is the ESAP going to be set up?\": \"The ESAP has three main components: Access to data: Determining how the information will be collected from private entities, such as issuers of securities, funds, auditors, banks, insurance companies or intermediaries. For this, the ESAP will build on existing channels. Depending on the type of information, entities will be required to file the information only once with a collection body which can be an existing repository (for instance the Officially Appointed Mechanisms) or an existing authority (a national competent authority in the financial services area or a European Supervisory Authority). Each collection body will then make the information fully available to the ESAP.Data infrastructure: The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) will design the necessary infrastructure, possibly building on cloud or other technologies. For example, the ESAP will offer automated translation services and search tools.Data availability: barriers to the use and re-use of data will be removed. The information will be available for free, including for downloads. Data will not generally be subject to any conditions for use or re-use. For any situations where conditions are required, they will be based on permissible open standard licences. Open formats will be used which will enable data extraction, with an increasing amount of information made machine-readable in the long-run.\", \"Why did you choose ESMA to run the ESAP?\": \"An overwhelming majority of stakeholders expressed their preference for putting an EU body in charge. The Commission is proposing to give ESMA the responsibility of building, operating and governing the ESAP. This will be the most effective, predictable and coherent way to run the ESAP. Public funds (EU and Member States) will fully cover the costs necessary to build and manage the ESAP.\", \"Why should public funds support all the costs associated with the ESAP, as the private sector will benefit the most out of this?\": \"Information relevant for financial services, capital markets and sustainability, published by private entities is seen by many stakeholders as a public good. An approach where costs would have to be supported by sources of revenues, such as user fees, would contradict the open data policy goal of this project. Enabling free access would be necessary because even the slightest barrier might have widespread effects on users. In addition, this approach reduces risks of conflicts of interests or of a de facto monopoly on information.\", \"What are the benefits of giving small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) the ability to post information voluntarily on the ESAP?\": \"Market fragmentation affects particularly SME access to finance, which can in turn hamper their ability to expand beyond their own national borders. Data integration will remove part of this fragmentation. The ESAP will enable any entity, in particular SMEs, to file relevant information voluntarily. This will enhance SMEs' visibility towards EU and international investors, such as business angels, venture capital or private equity funds and diversify their sources of funding.\", \"How will stakeholders and consumers benefit?\": \"The ESAP will increase the availability of company and investment product information, both within and among Member States. It will make companies more visible to investors, analysists, intermediates, researchers or funds, regardless of their size or the size of their national market. This will open up funding opportunities and ensure a better allocation of capital, thereby contributing to a lower cost of capital. It will offer easy access to a wider array of information in a timely and efficient manner. The ESAP will also help address a growing demand for sustainability-related data by investors, companies, NGOs and civil society contributing to the objectives of the European Green Deal. By making information available in an extractable format or in a machine-readable format, ESAP would also enable the use and re-use of companies' data and would also make a significant contribution to the digital transformation of finance, in line with the Commission's Digital Finance Strategy. European Long-Term Investment Fund (ELTIF) framework review Fund managers will be able to invest in a broader range of eligible assets making it easier and to design investment strategies. More flexible rules will make it easier for fund managers to set up ELTIFs. Retail investors will have greater access to ELTIF investments, allowing them to meet their long-term investment and savings needs. The liquidity window redemption mechanism will allow investors the possibility to exit their ELTIF investments prior to the fund's maturity but only under specified conditions that minimise the impact on the fund value and the remaining investors. Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) review While in principle stakeholders consider that the AIFMD framework works well, the majority welcome the approach of clarifying certain rules. The key benefit for stakeholders will be the common rules on loan-originating funds. These will foster the establishment of a stable and diversified supply of alternative credit for EU companies. Increased availability and competition between loan-originating funds will increase the availability and lower the cost of credit, particularly for SMEs and other companies in Member States where this activity is currently prohibited. In addition, investors will benefit from increased investor protection from better managed loan-originating funds and more transparency around their activities. They will also benefit from the clarification of delegation rules, which facilitates better enforcement of the rules. The new requirements on liquidity management tools will strengthen the liquidity risk management process, particularly in times of crisis. Review of the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR) (consolidated tape) and Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) The consolidated tape is a centralised database that will provide easy access to consolidated market data to all investors, large and small (asset managers, pension funds, retail investors), and to financial intermediaries, such as brokers. Today, many people do not realise financial instruments may trade on multiple different markets and at different prices across the EU. The consolidated tape will reduce the advantage that the biggest market players enjoy over the rest of the market, which includes not only retail investors but also smaller European asset managers and banks, which represent the majority of institutional investors. It should help intermediaries to decrease trade execution risks and lead to an improvement of best execution that can be more easily documented by brokers and checked by different types of investors. In the meantime, the consolidated tape will increase the visibility of financial instruments across European markets, bringing benefits to issuers as well as exchanges and the whole market ecosystem. This should in particular help SME stocks gain wider visibility than that achieved by their own local markets. This will reinforce the attractiveness of investments and the possibility of shares being included in investment funds or investment portfolios. Ultimately, this could favour the effectiveness of raising capital for these stocks. Finally, the prohibition of PFOF (\\u2018payment for order flow') ensures that brokers obtain the best deal for their clients by exploring various execution options and selecting the best ones based on objective measures including the best price and trading conditions, instead of basing their choice on the remuneration they receive from the executing party.\", \"Why is the Commission proposing this review?\": \"ELTIFs have a crucial role to play by providing a dedicated investment product to mobilise capital for the financing of long-term projects such as transport infrastructure, sustainable energy generation or distribution, or social infrastructure (such as housing for older people or hospitals). The ELTIF market is still relatively new, but it is evident that it has not scaled up to the extent originally envisaged, with only 57 authorised ELTIFs in four Member States as of October 2021. Amendments are necessary to improve the attractiveness and effectiveness of the framework for investment managers and investors. This review aims to increase the uptake of ELTIFs across the EU. This, in turn, would support the continued development of the CMU, which also aims to make it easier for EU companies to access more stable and diverse long-term financing. The Commission is reviewing the application and the scope of the AIFMD, as foreseen in article 69 of this Directive. While the review shows that in principle the AIFMD framework works well, some targeted changes were needed to better integrate the market for alternative investment funds, ensure investor protection and better monitor risks to financial stability posed by AIF. The aim of the review is to remove the main obstacles to the creation of a consolidated tape, enhance transparency and increase competitiveness of EU markets in the global landscape. The main objective is to introduce an EU-wide consolidated tape for shares, bonds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and derivatives. Today, financial instruments are traded across various execution platforms. All these platforms need to publish information, such as the volume, time and price of each individual transaction. For smaller investors, including retail investors, it is impossible to obtain a complete picture of the market. Even for the most sophisticated investment firms, it is complex and expensive. This means that no one can really be sure that they are getting or offering the best deals. The introduction of a consolidated tape will therefore eliminate the obstacles that currently prevent a consolidated view of this information across the EU. Furthermore, while the Commission recognises that large orders should benefit from exemptions to the general transparency framework, this is much less the case for small orders. That is why the proposal also aims to ensure that small orders are always transparent, regardless of whether they are executed on a multilateral platform or via investment banks. Finally, the review will introduce measures to increase the competitiveness of EU market players in the global markets, by fine-tuning the derivative trading obligation and the share trading obligation, and by removing the open access obligation. Better information on prices for financial investments in shares, ETFs and bonds makes the Union more attractive for international investors.\", \"What are the key elements of the review?\": \"Based on the outcome of the review, amendments are proposed in three key areas: Broadening the scope of eligible assets and investments, and reducing certain fund rule limitations to allow greater flexibility for fund managers to design appropriate investment strategies and portfolio compositions for ELTIFs.Reducing the barriers to entry for retail investors while ensuring appropriate levels of investor protection.Introducing an additional liquidity window redemption mechanism that will allow investors the possibility to exit an ELTIF investment earlier subject to certain conditions. The review proposes targeted and proportionate improvements to the current regulatory framework, addressing a number of regulatory gaps, and where EU action is needed. In particular: Common rules on loan-originating funds: The proposal introduces common minimal rules regarding direct lending by alternative investment funds (AIFs) to companies. These rules will allow loan-originating funds to operate cross-border and ensure that they can be an alternative source of funding for companies in addition to bank lending.   At the same time the proposed rules will address potential risks related to this type of lending. Efficiency of reporting to the supervisory authorities: The proposal aims to improve access to relevant data collection for both national and EU authorities and remove inefficient reporting duplications. Harmonised Liquidity Management Tools (LMT): The legislative proposal harmonises the set of liquidity management tools to better facilitate liquidity risk management by managers of open-ended alternative investment funds, in line with recommendations by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). Improved availability of depositaries in concentrated markets: The objective is to address the problems in concentrated markets with few depositaries, by enabling National Competent Authorities to allow the AIFs concerned to appoint a depositary situated in another Member State. Smooth functioning of the custody chain: The Central Securities Depositaries appearing in the custody chain will be regarded as delegates of the depositary. This enables the depositaries to obtain the necessary information on portfolio movements and to perform their oversight duties where the fund's assets are kept by a Central Securities Depositary. Ensuring the protection of investor interests in case of delegation: The proposal provides improved clarity on the rules on delegation and ensures that fund managers adhere to high standards applicable across the EU when they make use of delegation. The proposal seeks to achieve a coherent approach to delegation activities by AIFMs and their supervisors. In order to develop a reliable overview of the delegation activities in the EU, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) will receive data on delegation and conduct peer reviews, and report its conclusions to the Commission and the co-legislators. 1) The establishment of an EU wide consolidated tape The review will create the conditions for the emergence of a consolidated tape. First, all data contributors will be mandated to contribute their data to the consolidated tape provider. Second, the data contributions need to be made by means of harmonised data standards to ensure that the data is usable and comparable. Third and final, for the tape on shares, the consolidated tape would share its revenue with the data contributors to compensate for their loss of revenue. Such a consolidated tape is crucial for investors. Since it will give all investors, large and small, timely and transparent access to market data, investors will have a consolidated view of trading conditions across the EU. An EU consolidated tape would provide investors with information on whether they obtained the best price for selling or buying securities. It could also improve competition between trading venues, by attracting orders to trading facilities with better prices and better liquidity. Since the consolidated tape will also be available to retail investors, it will contribute to the democratisation of trading in the EU and increase the participation of citizens in capital markets. Better information on prices for financial investments in shares, ETFs, bonds and derivatives will make the EU more attractive for international investors. The proposal also contains provisions on publishing bond prices earlier than currently. This makes the price comparison tool even more valuable. All of this information will be available also for international investors. This will lead to EU capital markets becoming more attractive, not only internally, but also internationally. 2) Other changes to market structure Boosting transparency and levelling the playing field The proposal aims to change EU trading rules to enhance transparency in EU financial markets and level the playing field between execution platforms. Small trades in equities (such as shares) will be banned from being executed in \\u201cdark pools\\u201d (i.e. traders not subject to transparency requirements). When they are executed via large investment banks, they should be made fully transparent. Furthermore, for non-equities (such as derivatives and bonds), transparency will be significantly increased by reducing recourse to so-called \\u2018deferrals' that allow for the delayed publication of core details of transactions. These measures improve the price formation process and increase the level playing field between various execution platforms. The practice where retail brokers forward the orders from their clients to a limited number of traders in exchange for compensation (\\u2018payment for order flow' or \\u2018PFOF') will be banned. This will ensure that brokers are acting in the best interest of their clients. Increasing competitiveness Another key objective of the proposal is to strengthen the competitiveness of EU financial markets. We are doing so by removing the \\u2018open access obligation' for exchange-trade derivatives and by adjusting the scope of the EU share trading obligation and derivatives trading obligation. In order to incentivise innovation in the market for exchange traded derivatives, central clearing houses no longer are required to make available their clearing systems for the purpose of clearing exchange traded derivatives from non-affiliated trading venues. The \\u2018open access' rules may remove incentives for exchanges to create new and innovative financial products. It was already postponed multiple times and will now be abandoned. The obligation to trade shares on eligible execution platforms in the EU will be streamlined so that it only applies to shares with a primary listing in the EU. EU shares traded on a third country venue will be exempted as far as they are denominated in local currency. Furthermore, the obligation to trade certain derivatives on exchanges will be aligned with the scope of the clearing obligation. Lastly, the Commission will be able to suspend the trading obligation in cross border relationships when necessary. This could for example be the case when conflicting trading obligations in two jurisdictions prevent an EU counterparty to enter into a derivatives contract with a non-EU counterparty.\", \"Will the proposed changes reduce the level of investor protection, particularly for retail investors?\": \"No. The proposed changes to the treatment of retail investors will make it easier for retail investors to invest in ELTIFs as part of their overall investment strategy but maintain appropriate levels of investor protection with the MIFID II suitability test. One of the core objectives of the ELTIF Regulation is to establish a retail alternative investment fund product to meet long-term investment needs with a well-regulated framework that allows retail customers to invest in these funds.\", \"Why is the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive (UCITS) changed?\": \"When considering these changes, the impact on the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive (UCITS) was also considered. As such, we will update UCITS to reflect changes to AIFMD where necessary, for instance on liquidity management tools, delegation, and reporting.\", \"Why did you not make further changes on delegation?\": \"There are great merits in delegation. Delegation allows fund managers to source necessary expertise in a particular geographic market or asset class. It has contributed to the global success of EU funds, notably UCITS. As fund managers remain bound by EU rules and maintain full liability towards their funds and investors, investors are covered by investor protection measures provided for in EU law. Therefore, no major overhaul of the current rules is needed. Today's proposal contains a number of clarifications and requires information exchanges between supervisors and convergence measures, in particular peer reviews, to be performed by ESMA. These peer reviews should focus on measures preventing AIFMs \\u2013 which delegate performance of portfolio management or risk management to entities located in third countries \\u2013 from becoming letter-box entities.\", \"Will the consolidated tape have a negative impact on the business model of stock exchanges?\": \"No, the consolidated tape will not negatively affect the business model of stock exchanges. This new tool could even constitute a big opportunity. The consolidated tape will offer a consolidated view of the entire European markets that today is not widely available, thereby making European trading more attractive and dynamic. The data published by the consolidated tape will not be a substitute for other market data, such as fast proprietary trade feeds that are sold by exchanges and represent a significant part of their market data revenues. Moreover, the consolidated tape provider for shares will remunerate exchanges for their role as data contributors. Smaller exchanges play an essential role for listing companies and for the life of the shares they admit to trading since in general these shares remain largely traded on them. It is therefore appropriate to safeguard the role of these smaller exchanges for a rich and vibrant local ecosystem, in line with the objectives of the Capital Markets Union. As their data is essential for the tape, they are entitled to receive a preferential tranche in the revenue generated by the share consolidated tape. This redistribution mechanism will be an essential feature of the consolidated tape framework that will guarantee that interests of different parties are aligned.\", \"Open access: why not keep this provision?\": \"The open access provisions for exchange-traded derivatives have been suspended multiple times by the co-legislators for a variety of reasons. In order not to endanger the orderly functioning of markets or financial stability, the Commission deems it necessary to remove this open access obligation. Open access could reduce the attractiveness for stock exchanges of investing in new products, as competitors may be able to get access without the upfront investment. Therefore, removing the open access obligation would foster innovation and the development of exchange-traded derivatives in the EU. This in turn benefits the EU's market participants when stock exchanges offer affordable, attractive and innovative products. Furthermore, it would reflect the long-standing international trend of vertical integration between trading and clearing for derivatives.\", \"Will the consolidated tape offer real-time information on trading?\": \"Our assessment shows that to meet the multiple needs of the different stakeholders and attract many subscriptions, a close-to-real time as technically possible consolidated tape seems most appropriate. The exchange would provide investors such as asset managers and pension funds with an essential tool to manage their investments. While the legislative framework will not mandate a specific speed of delivery for the tape and leave it to market forces to decide what is best for the tool, this aspect will be one of the key criteria for a tender process.\", \"How will the mechanism on the trading obligation for derivatives (DTO) work in practice? Does it undermine cooperation with other jurisdictions?\": \"According to the derivatives trading obligation (DTO) rules, derivatives that are in-scope of the requirements must be traded on EU venues or on third-country venues that have been granted equivalence. The suspension mechanism for the DTO will be a self-standing mechanism, independent of the suspension of the clearing obligation. The mechanism could be activated by the Commission in the form of an Implementing Act at the request of a national competent authority, with respect to an investment firm that is a market maker in a derivative subject to the DTO and interacts with non-EU counterparts. The suspension needs to be accompanied by evidence from the national competent authority that the conditions for suspension are met and the Commission will take into account whether such suspension would have a distortive effect on clearing. The suspension mechanism has absolutely no effect on international cooperation. It does not take away the importance of equivalence decisions.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6269\": {\"What is the EU Air Safety List?\": \"The EU Air Safety List (ASL) is a list of air carriers from non-EU countries, which do not fulfil international safety standards. The carriers on the ASL are banned from operating to, in and from the EU. Carriers that do not operate to the EU can also be put on the ASL, in order to warn the public travelling outside of the EU about safety concerns. If the safety authorities of a third country are not able to fulfil their international safety oversight obligations, all the carriers of that country can be put on the ASL. The ASL, while not popular with the affected countries and carriers, has developed into a strong, and internationally recognised tool to help improve the safety of international aviation. This is the case both for flights to the EU, but also for aviation outside of the EU. ASL is also seen as a strong preventive tool, because when under scrutiny, countries tend to improve their safety oversight to avoid seeing their air carriers on the list.\", \"Which carriers are currently on the EU Air Safety List?\": \"After the update of November 2021, the 38th update, 97 air carriers are banned from EU skies: 90 airlines certified in 15 states[1], due to a lack of safety oversight by the aviation authorities in these states;Seven individual airlines, based on safety concerns with regard to these airlines themselves: Avior Airlines (Venezuela), Blue Wing Airlines (Suriname), Iran Aseman Airlines (Iran), Iraqi Airways (Iraq), Med-View Airlines (Nigeria), Skol Airline LLC (Russia) and Air Zimbabwe (Zimbabwe). An additional two airlines are subject to operational restrictions and can only fly to the EU with specific aircraft types: Iran Air (Iran) and Air Koryo (North Korea).\", \"Who is responsible for the updates to the EU Air Safety List?\": \"In updating the list, the Commission is assisted by the EU Air Safety Committee (ASC), which comprises aviation safety experts from all the EU Member States and is chaired by the Commission, with support from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Acting on a proposal by the Commission, the ASC adopts its opinion by qualified majority, which is then submitted to the European Parliament before final adoption by the Commission, and subsequent publication in the Official Journal. To date, all decisions taken by the Commission to impose or to lift restrictions have been reached with unanimous support from the ASC and the European Parliament's Transport Committee.\", \"What is the procedure for updates to the EU Air Safety List?\": \"All EU Member States and EASA are obliged to communicate information that may be relevant for the update of the ASL to the Commission. The European Commission and the ASC use a variety of information sources when assessing whether or not international safety standards are respected. These include sources like the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the United States Federal Aviation Administration, EASA, SAFA[2] and TCO[3] reports, as well as information gathered by individual EU Member States and the Commission itself. It is important to note that this assessment is made against international safety standards (and not the EU safety standards, which are sometimes more stringent), and notably the standards promulgated by the ICAO.\", \"To whom does it apply?\": \"The rules establishing the list of banned carriers apply to all air carriers, irrespective of their nationality \\u2013 EU and non-EU. They apply only to commercial air transport, i.e. to the air transport of passengers and cargo for remuneration or hire. The rules do not apply to private and non-commercial flights (e.g. positioning flights for maintenance purposes).\", \"How often is the list updated and what is the timeframe for this? Is there not a risk that it will quickly become obsolete?\": \"The ASL may be updated whenever the Commission deems it is necessary, or upon request of an EU Member State. The ASC normally meets two or three times every year, as necessary. For emergencies, a specific procedure is in place.\", \"How can an airline be cleared and taken off the list?\": \"If an airline considers that it should be taken off the list because it complies with the relevant safety standards, it can address a request to the Commission, either directly or through its civil aviation authority. For a ban to be lifted, sufficient evidence must be provided to the EU, to prove that the capacity of the airline and of its oversight authority to implement international safety standards is of a sufficient level. The Commission services will then assess the evidence presented by the airline and/or its oversight authority to substantiate its request. If the result of the assessment is positive, the Commission will make a proposal to the ASC. Notwithstanding the case of individual air carriers, if the underlying reason for an air carrier being on the ASL is a poor level of compliance with ICAO standards by its safety oversight authorities, it will require the state to address the significant non-compliances before that air carrier can be removed from the list. In practical terms, this involves the air carrier and its state providing written information, attending meetings with the Commission and EU Member States, sometimes being subject to an on-site visit led by the Commission, and taking part in hearings in front of the ASC.\", \"How is an airline added to the list?\": \"If the Commission or an EU Member State acquires and confirms evidence indicating serious safety deficiencies on the part of an airline or its oversight authority anywhere in the world, the list will be updated to include this airline or all the airlines of the country in question.\", \"Does the inclusion of an airline in the EU Air Safety List always mean that it is no longer allowed to fly in Europe?\": \"Yes. As long as the air carrier is subject to a total ban, neither its aircraft nor its personnel can operate in the European Union's airspace. The airline is included in Annex A to the regulation. Equally, as long as an air carrier is subject to a partial ban it can operate only with the aircraft stipulated in the Regulation. The airline is included in Annex B of the regulation. Banned airlines can, however, use the aircraft and personnel of other airlines, which are not on the ASL, on the basis of contracts called \\u2018wet-lease agreements'. In this way, passengers and cargo can still be transported on the basis of tickets sold by a banned airline, and the flight is operated by airlines that fully comply with the safety rules. Furthermore, aircraft used for government or state purposes (e.g. transport of the heads of state and/or government, humanitarian flights), do not fall under the safety requirements of ICAO. Such aircraft are considered to be operating \\u2018state flights' and can fly into the EU even if commercial flights are banned. However, such flights do need special authorisation (\\u2018diplomatic clearance') from all the EU Member States that the state aircraft overflies, as well as from the state of destination. In essence, banned airlines cannot enter the sovereign airspace of any EU Member State and fly over their territory while they are banned (totally or partially).\", \"Does the list prevent EU Member States from taking individual safety measures at a national level?\": \"No. The general principle is that whatever measure is considered at national level must also be examined at European Union level. When an air carrier is considered unsafe and therefore banned in one EU Member State, there is an obligation to examine this measure at EU level with a view to applying it throughout the European Union. Nevertheless, even where a ban is not extended to the EU, there is scope for EU Member States to continue to act at national level in certain exceptional cases, particularly in emergencies or in response to a safety issue specifically affecting them.\", \"What are airlines' \\u2018rights of defence'?\": \"Airlines that have been banned, or that are being investigated in view of a potential ban, have the right to express their points of view, submit any documents that they consider appropriate for their defence, and make oral and written presentations to the ASC and the Commission. This means that they can submit comments in writing, add new items to their file, and ask to be heard by the Commission or to attend a hearing before the ASC, which then formulates its opinion based on these proceedings and the materials submitted prior to or during the hearing.\", \"Is the Commission approach a punitive one?\": \"The Commission's sole aim is to improve aviation safety, which is in everyone's interest, and in no way to affect a country's economic or social development. Countries affected can put in place technical assistance measures to help airlines achieve a satisfactory level of aviation safety. While in the past the focus has been to put countries and carriers on the ASL, the Commission is now also working with affected states to help them improve their safety situation so that they may be released from the ASL once the necessary safety levels have been reached.\", \"How is the public informed about the EU Air Safety List?\": \"The latest version of the list is available to the public online at https://transport.ec.europa.eu/transport-themes/eu-air-safety-list_en. The Commission also liaises closely with European and international travel agent associations each time that any changes are made to the list so that they are in the best possible position to assist their clients \\u2013 the passengers \\u2013 in making informed decisions when making travel arrangements. Moreover, the ASL Regulation also obliges national civil aviation authorities, EASA and airports in the territory of the EU Member States to bring the ASL to the attention of passengers, both via their websites and, where relevant, in their premises.\", \"In what way does the EU Air Safety List provide rights to European travellers?\": \"The ASL Regulation establishes the right of any passenger to know the identity of every airline they fly with throughout their trip. To this effect, the contracting carrier is required to inform passengers of the identity of the operating air carrier or carriers when making a reservation, however the booking is made. The passenger must also be kept informed of any change of operating carrier, either at check-in or, at the latest, when boarding. The Regulation also gives passengers the right to reimbursement or re-routing if a carrier with which a booking has been made is subsequently added to the ASL, resulting in the cancellation of the flight concerned.\", \"In what way does the publication of the EU Air Safety List help European citizens travelling beyond EU territory?\": \"The ASL does not only ban unsafe airlines from operating to, from and in the EU. The publication of the list also provides useful information to people wishing to travel outside the European Union, so that they may avoid flying with these airlines if they wish. The list also safeguards the rights of consumers who have bought a trip at a travel agent, which includes a flight operated by an airline on the ASL.\", \"What is the difference between this EU Air Safety List and the new EU Regulation blacklisting transport operators that engage in trafficking or smuggling people into the EU?\": \"The decisions made by the Commission regarding the Air Safety List are purely driven by technical safety considerations and result only from the failure to demonstrate compliance with international safety standards. The newly announced measure against transport operators involved in trafficking persons or smuggling migrants into EU territory aim at protecting the lives and safety of people, also when being instrumentalised for political ends, and safeguarding the security of the EU's external borders. They may be taken against any aircraft operator involved in such activities, regardless of their status in relation to the air safety list. The new measure also applies to operators in other modes of transport, not only aviation.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6212\": {\"Why is the Commission proposing a legislation on political adverts?\": \"Political advertising is increasingly used in Europe, including across borders. Currently it is regulated by Member States with a specific focus on traditional media (television, newspaper), and serious gaps and loopholes exist. The fragmented legal framework creates costs for service providers and acts as a disincentive to the provision of political advertising services across borders. As a result, it is not always easy for people to recognise whether they are looking at a political ad, especially when such ad appears online. This means that citizens cannot fully exercise their democratic rights and national authorities monitor the correct application of the rules. Moreover, high standards of transparency of political advertising support accountability of those behind such advertisements and the right for citizens to be informed in an objective, transparent and pluralistic way. Finally, personal data is also used to target and amplify political advertising, which can create negative effects on citizens' rights including their freedoms of opinion and of information, to make political decisions and exercise their voting rights.\", \"How do you define \\u2018political advertising'? How will the political nature of the advertisement be determined?\": \"\\u2018Political advertising' means the preparation, placement, promotion, publication or dissemination by any means, of a message: by, for or on behalf of a political actor, unless it is of a purely private or a purely commercial nature; orwhich is liable to influence the outcome of an election or referendum, a legislative or regulatory process or voting behaviour. Since advertisements by, for or on behalf of a political actor cannot be detached from their activity in their role as political actor, they will be presumed to be liable to influence the political debate, except for messages of purely private or purely commercial nature. To determine whether a message is liable to influence the outcome of an election or referendum, a legislative or regulatory process or voting behaviour, account should be taken of all relevant factors such as the content of the message, the language used to convey the message, the context in which the message is conveyed, the objective of the message and the means by which the message is published or disseminated. Providers of advertising services will have to request sponsors (and providers of advertising services acting on behalf of sponsors) to declare whether the advertising service they request constitutes a political advertising service.\", \"How will people know they are looking at a political ad and why?\": \"This initiative aims to set high standards of transparency of paid political advertising services, and to strengthen the protection of fundamental rights of citizens. This means that with every political advertisement people will hear or see: a statement that the advertisement is political;the identity of the sponsor of the political advertisement, including any the entity ultimately controlling the sponsor;a transparency notice or a clear indication of where it can be easily retrieved. The transparency notice is an important element as it will include information, which will allow people to understand the wider context of the political advertisement and its aims. It will include: the identity of the sponsor and contact details;the period during which the political advertisement is intended to be published and disseminated;information on the aggregated amounts spent or other benefits received in part or full exchange for the preparation, placement, promotion, publication and dissemination of the relevant advertisement, and of the political advertising campaign where relevant, and their sources;where applicable, an indication of elections or referendums with which the advertisement is linked;where applicable, links to online repositories of advertisements;information on the mechanism for citizens to indicate political advertising which may not comply with the Regulation;where applicable, information about how the advertising is targeted and amplified.\", \"Will targeting people with political ads be banned?\": \"No, not in general. However, political targeting and amplification techniques using or inferring from sensitive personal data (as defined under GDPR) will be banned \\u2013 unless a person explicitly consents to it. Sensitive personal data reveals racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, as well as genetic, biometric and health data or information concerning a person's sex life or sexual orientation. Targeting could also be allowed in the context of political advertising of the legitimate activities of organisations with a political, philosophical, religious or trade union aim when for instance it targets their own members. Anyone making use of political targeting and amplification involving the processing of personal data will also need to: adopt and implement an internal policy on the use of such techniques;keep records of the techniques used and sources of personal information;provide the targeted person with additional information concerning the targeting or amplification, including:the specific groups targeted,the parameters used to determine the recipients to whom the advertising is disseminated (with the same level of detail as used for the targeting),the categories of personal data used for the targeting and amplification,the targeting and amplification goals, mechanisms and logic including the inclusion and exclusion parameters and the reasons for choosing these parameters,the period of dissemination, the number of individuals to whom the advertisement is disseminated and indications of the size of the targeted audience within the relevant electorate,the source of the personal data use, including, where applicable, information that the personal data was derived, inferred, or obtained from a third party and its identity as well as a link to the data protection notice of that third party for the processing at stake;a link to effective means to support individuals' exercise of their rights under EU data protection rules. Publishers of political adverts will need to ensure that this additional information about the targeting of political advertising they publish is included in the transparency notices they make available with the political advertisement.\", \"What are the (new) obligations for platforms, media publishers, advertising agencies, etc. proposed in this Regulation?\": \"The proposed Regulation lays down rules for all the actors in the advertising value chain, both online and offline. Each of these players will need to play their part to ensure that the right level of transparency and accountability is set in the EU for political advertising and that individuals are well equipped to understand political ads when they see them. All political advertising services, from ad tech that intermediate the placement of ads, to consultancies and advertising agencies producing the advertising campaigns, will have to retain the information they have access to through the provision of their service about the ad, the sponsor and the dissemination of the ad. They will have to transfer this information to the publisher of the political ad \\u2013 this can be the website or app where the ad is seen by an individual, a newspaper, a TV broadcaster, a radio station, etc. The publisher will need to make the information available to the individual who sees the ad. Political advertising publishers have to publish the following for each political advertisement in a clear and unambiguous way: a clear statement to the effect that it is a political advertisement;the identity of the sponsor of the political advertisement and the entity ultimately controlling the sponsor; anda transparency notice explaining the wider context of the political advertisement and its aims, or a clear indication of where it can be easily retrieved. Political advertising publishers should use efficient and prominent marking and labelling that allow the political advertisement to be easily identified as such and should ensure that the marking or labelling remains in place in case a political advertisement is further disseminated.\", \"Does the proposed Regulation cover only companies or also political parties and foundations?\": \"The requirements on transparency, aimed to contribute to the good functioning of the internal market, have a different scope of addressee to the requirements concerning targeting and amplification, which protect individual rights. The requirements concerning the transparency of political advertising proposed by the new Regulation apply to the entire production chain of advertisement \\u2013 whether a PR company, data broker or an online platform. The Regulation does not require disclosure of private communications and the rules are without prejudice to the ePrivacy legal framework. The requirements on targeting and amplification apply to anyone who targets or amplifies political advertising using personal data. This would cover in many instances service providers, but also other actors like political parties.\", \"With this initiative, what will political ads look like for citizens?\": \"Transparency of political advertising will help people understand when they see a paid political advertisement. With the proposed rules, every political advertisement \\u2013 whether on Twitter, Facebook or any other online platform \\u2013 will have to be clearly marked as political advertisement as well as include the identity of the sponsor and a transparency notice with the wider context of the political advertisement and its aims, or a clear indication of where it can be easily retrieved.\", \"What about political adverts that originate from outside the EU?\": \"This initiative applies to all political advertising prepared, placed, published or disseminated in the European Union, or directed to individuals in one or several Member States, irrespective of where the advertising services provider is based, and irrespective of the means used. Moreover, organisations which provide political advertising services in the European Union which do not have a physical presence here will have to designate a legal representative in one of the Member States where the services are offered. This will ensure more transparency and accountability of services providers acting from outside the Union.\", \"How does this proposal complement the rules in the Digital Services Act and the ongoing efforts under the Code of Practice against disinformation?\": \"The Commission proposed the Digital Services Act (DSA) in December 2020 to ensure that online intermediaries and online platforms in particular are covered by one set of horizontal rules across the EU. The rules should empower and protect individuals and offer the best conditions in the single market for responsible services to develop. The DSA includes rules on content moderation, as well as specific obligations for the transparency and accountability of the advertising systems of online platforms. This includes any type of ads, from commercial communications to issues-based and political ads. Obligations cover a notice-and-action system for illegal ads, user-facing transparency, as well as a mandatory risk management process for very large online platforms, accompanied by public scrutiny through independent audits, ad repositories publicly accessible, and data &access for vetted researchers. The political ads initiative builds on it and proposes general transparency obligations for all actors involved in the financing, preparation, placement and dissemination of political advertising, offline and online. It is both wider through its material scope covering online and offline ads, and narrower, covering only political ads. It focuses on the specificities of political advertising and expands the categories of information to be disclosed. The political ads proposal also aims at complementing and strengthening the self-regulatory, industry-led actions that the Code of Practice on Disinformation has pioneered. The proposal provides for regulatory obligations related to several commitments of the Code and the relevant expectations developed in the Commission Guidance on strengthening the Code of Practice on Disinformation.\", \"Will this legislation restrict free speech or ban certain content?\": \"No. Beyond the requirements for transparency and targeting, the initiative does not interfere with the substantive content of political messages. Since advertisements by, for or on behalf of a political actor cannot be detached from their activity in their role as political actor, they can be presumed to be liable to influence the political debate, except for messages of purely private or purely commercial nature. Also, in full respect of freedom of expression as protected by Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, this Regulation should not apply to messages shared by individuals in their purely personal capacity. The obligations under the proposed Regulation connected to political advertising are only engaged in connection to the processing of personal data, or if political advertising services are involved. In particular, the transparency rules should only apply to political advertising services, i.e. political advertising that is normally provided for remuneration, which may include a benefit in kind. The transparency requirements should not apply to content uploaded by a user of an online intermediary service, such as an online platform, and disseminated by the online intermediary service without consideration for the placement, publication or dissemination for the specific message, unless the user has been remunerated by a third party for the political advertisement.\", \"Who will ensure oversight of this law?\": \"The use of personal data in political targeting and amplification will be monitored by the national Data Protection Authorities (DPAs). For the other elements of the proposal, relating to the transparency rules, designated national authorities will monitor the compliance with the new rules. For digital services, these may be the same authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Digital Services Act and the regulatory coordination within the Member State of establishment and across Member States will be ensured through the Digital Services Coordinators designated for the DSA.\", \"How can violations of the law be reported?\": \"Political advertising publishers will have to put mechanisms in place to enable individuals to report, free of charge, to them that a particular political advertisement, does not comply with this Regulation. The mechanisms to report such advertisement should be user friendly and easy to access, including from the transparency notice. The political advertising publisher should inform individuals of the follow-up after an ad has been reported. Member States will also need to designate authorities to supervise the application of the regulation and enforce it.\", \"Will there be fines?\": \"When it comes to the breaches relating to the use of personal data in targeting and amplification techniques, the national data protection supervisory authorities will be able to impose fines in line with EU data protection rules. For infringements of the transparency requirements applicable to political advertisings, Member States will need to lay down rules on effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions applicable to providers of political advertising services under their jurisdiction. The scale of such fines is to be determined by Member States. Funding of European political parties and foundations\", \"What is the role of European political parties and European political foundations?\": \"European political parties are transnational political alliances that unite national and regional parties, as well as citizens, with the same ideological affinity. At present, ten European political parties and ten European political foundations are registered. Together with their affiliated foundations, European political parties fulfil an essential role in representative European democracy by creating a direct link between the citizens and the political system. Strong European political parties and foundations that can foster political debate across Europe are essential for creating a truly European public sphere.\", \"Why is the Commission proposing to review the current rules?\": \"Both European Parliament and Commission evaluated the application of current rules and found that, while their overall legal framework is fit for purpose, there are still a number of loopholes hindering European political parties and foundations from fully fulfilling their respective roles and tasks. Moreover, the recast of the Regulation will provide European political parties and foundations with a consolidated legal text taking into account all revisions to date.\", \"What are the main changes introduced by the new rules?\": \"The proposal aims at   ensuring financial viability of European political parties, while reinforcing the transparency requirements on their sources of funding. The proposal contains measures to cut administrative burden, to modulate the sanctioning regime, and to reinforce transparency on gender representation and compliance with EU fundamental values. It will also ensure that the new rules on transparency of political advertising also apply to the European political parties and foundations. Overall, the proposal will improve legal certainty for all actors concerned, including clarifying the cross-border nature of EUPPs activities, including campaigning.\", \"What are the changes into funding regimes of European political parties and foundations? Is there enough safeguards to prevent from foreign interference?\": \"There are certain changes, aimed at increasing their financial viability. The Commission proposes to reduce the co-financing rate for European political parties from 10 to 5%, thereby aligning it with that of the European political foundations. In addition, the legislative proposal envisages to lower the co-financing rate even further (to 0%) in the year of the elections to the European Parliament. This measure should help European political parties to increase the number and intensity of their campaign activities and, therefore, increase their visibility also at national level. Apart from contributions from the EU budget, the current rules (Regulation 1141/2014) acknowledge only two categories of revenues for European political parties and foundations namely, contributions from members and donations; and the Commission proposes to amend the Regulation to create a third category of revenues (\\u2018own resources') allowing European political parties and foundations to broaden their revenue base. The proportion of own resources in the total budget of a European political party or foundations will be capped to mitigate the potential risk of interference. As regards contributions from members, the legislative proposal also aims at allowing European political parties and foundations to collect contributions from their member parties and member organisations located outside the European Union but inside the Council of Europe. To limit the risk of foreign interference, contribution from outside the Union can only amount to 10% of overall contributions which, in turn, can only amount to 40% of the party's annual budget. This cap, together with the requirement for European political parties and foundations to ensure that their member parties and member organisations outside the Union observe values that are equivalent to those of Article 2 TEU, should provide for the necessary safeguards as regards foreign funding. Donations from outside the Union will continue to be forbidden while the transparency regime for donation from inside the Union will be reinforced. Notably, a \\u2018know your donor' obligation (due diligence mechanism) will bind the European political parties and foundations to collect additional information for the identification of their donors so they know where the funding is coming from before they accept it. The Authority for European political parties and European political foundations will be granted the power to request such information directly from donors in case it has grounds to suspect irregularities. Electoral rights of EU citizens who live in a different Member State\", \"How many Europeans are \\u201cmobile\\u201d EU citizens i.e. live in a Member State that is not a Member State of their nationality?\": \"On 1 January 2020, there were 13.5 million EU citizens who live in another EU country (\\u201cmobile EU citizens\\u201d). About 12 million of them have, according the TEU, right to vote in municipal elections and in the European Parliament elections in the country where they reside.\", \"What are the main obstacles faced by those EU citizens in the context of their electoral rights?\": \"EU citizens who live in a different Member State than their nationality have low awareness of their political rights and on how to exercise those rights. They often have insufficient access to information on election procedures, face burdensome registration procedures and language barriers. They might also be discouraged from registering in their Member State of residence for fear of losing their right to vote in their home Member State for other types of elections (de-registration practices). Consequently, they have lower voter turnout compared to nationals.\", \"How will the new rules support those EU citizens to exercise electoral rights in the Member States of residence?\": \"The new rules will ensure that such EU citizens are better informed about their electoral rights in the Member State of residence. They will simplify their registration procedures and they will make sure that there are no negative consequences, such as loss of electoral rights in some elections in the Member State of origin, to their choice to register and vote in the Member State of residence.\", \"How will the new rules prevent multiple voting?\": \"The personal data of mobile EU citizens collected by national administrations through the standardised templates will act as a basis for a common data set to be exchanged between Member State administrations to reduce further the possibility of multiple voting in the same election. The aim is to facilitate the identification of mobile EU citizens who are registered to vote in more than one Member State in European Parliament Elections.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6179\": {}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6107\": {\"What does today's package include?\": \"Today, the European Commission presents: Annual Sustainable Growth Survey 2022Alert Mechanism Report 2022Proposal for a Joint Employment Report 2022Euro area recommendation 2022Communication on the 2022 Draft Budgetary Plans (DBPs)Opinions on the DBPs of 18 euro area Member StatesCommunication on the fiscal situation in RomaniaPost-programme surveillance reports for Cyprus, Ireland, Spain, and PortugalEnhanced surveillance report for Greece.\", \"What is the Annual Sustainable Growth Survey?\": \"The Annual Sustainable Growth Survey (ASGS) outlines the economic and employment policy priorities for the EU for the coming 12 to 18 months. Since the 2020 Semester cycle, the ASGS has been structured around the following dimensions of the EU's competitive sustainability agenda: environmental sustainability, productivity, fairness and macroeconomic stability.\", \"What are the main priorities in the Annual Sustainable Growth Survey?\": \"In addition to laying down the economic and employment policy priorities for the EU for the coming 12 to 18 months, the ASGS 2022 also sets out how the European Semester process will evolve in light of the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) implementation. Our starting point remains the four dimensions of the EU's competitive sustainability agenda (i.e. environmental sustainability productivity, fairness and macroeconomic stability) as defined at the start of this College's mandate. Where possible, Commission policy initiatives have been presented under each of these dimensions. Our policy efforts in dealing with the COVID-19 shock are bearing fruit. The focus now lies on ensuring a sustainable, fair and inclusive recovery, as well as on the medium- and long-term transformation of our economies, in line with the twin transition. The attention now crucially turns to implementation of Member States' recovery and resilience plans (RRPs) and other EU policy initiatives, such as the Fit for 55 Package, the Pillar of Social Rights and the Digital Decade. The ASGS also sets out how the European Semester and RRF processes will be integrated in 2022, with country reports and country-specific recommendations to be published in May. Finally, the ASGS describes how the UN Sustainable Development Goals will be further integrated in the Semester framework.\", \"How is the European Semester evolving this year and why?\": \"Implementing the RRF makes it necessary to continue adapting the European Semester, as the two processes are closely linked in terms of process and substance. This is partly due to the RRF Regulation's legal requirements, but it is also driven by the need to ensure efficiency and avoid overlaps in reporting obligations for Member States. The RRPs are a key tool for the delivery of the European Semester, as they address a significant subset of country-specific recommendations. Thus, the progress made in the implementation of RRPs is intrinsically linked to the monitoring of recommendations in the Semester.\", \"How will the Recovery and Resilience Facility process and the European Semester framework be organised in the future?\": \"The RRF makes it necessary to continue adapting the European Semester process, as RRF implementation will drive the reform and investment agenda for the years to come. The European Semester, with its broader scope and multilateral surveillance, will complement the implementation of the RRPs. The 2022 European Semester Spring package will include: Streamlined country reports, identifying gaps vis-a\\u0300-vis those challenges that are only partially or not addressed by RRPs.Country-specific recommendations to help bring forward Member States' efforts under RRPs, while addressing emerging socio-economic challenges to fast-forward the twin transition and build up resilience. There will also be fiscal recommendations. The two processes will be closely linked and the Commission will make every effort to ensure synergies and avoid administrative burdens for Member States by: Streamlining reporting obligations: for example, the national reform programmes will also be used for the bi-annual reporting under the RRF.Making use of IT tools to monitor both the implementation of the plans and the progress on country-specific recommendations.Integrating bilateral exchanges with Member States under the European Semester with the dialogue on the implementation of their RRPs. In the coming year, the implementation of RRPs will bring additional experience and knowledge on linkages between the Semester and the Facility. The 2022 cycle will be an opportunity to discuss these outcomes with Member States and relevant stakeholders to see if and how future European Semester cycles should further evolve.\", \"How does the economic governance review affect the content of this package? How should fiscal policies be designed for 2023?\": \"The Commission Opinions on the 2022 Draft Budgetary Plans assess the consistency of euro area Member States' fiscal plans with the June 2021 Council Recommendations. In parallel, the Commission relaunched the public consultation on the review of the EU's economic governance framework in October 2021. This framework is a central part of the coordination of EU's economic policy that aims at sustainable growth, job creation and sound public finances. The Commission invites all key stakeholders to engage in this public debate to build consensus on the future of the economic governance framework and will consider all views expressed. In the first quarter of 2022, the Commission will provide guidance for fiscal policy for the period ahead, to facilitate the coordination of fiscal policies and the preparation of Member States' Stability and Convergence Programmes. This guidance will reflect the global economic situation, the specific situation of each Member State and the discussion on the economic governance framework. Following that, in spring 2022, Member States will receive country-specific recommendations for 2023 on the basis of their Stability and Convergence Programmes. The Commission will provide orientations on possible changes to the economic governance framework to achieve a broad-based consensus on the way forward well in time for 2023.\", \"How will the UN sustainable development goals be further integrated into the European Semester?\": \"The 2020 European Semester cycle initiated the work on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) integration into the Semester, as called for by President von der Leyen in her 2019 Political Guidelines. As of the 2022 European Semester cycle, SDGs will be further integrated into the European Semester, with a fully updated and consistent SDG reporting across Member States: The yearly SDG monitor report issued by Eurostat will now be part of the European Semester documents, published in the 2022 Spring package.Each country report will include a section discussing the country's status, compared to the EU average, and progress in each SDG area.A combination of these two elements and additional indicators that monitor Member States' performance in view of key EU policy targets will inform the country reports and underpin country-specific recommendations.\", \"How will you involve stakeholders and the European Parliament in the European Semester/Recovery and Resilience Facility surveillance process?\": \"The Commission is committed to strengthening the democratic accountability of the Union's economic governance and will continue the strengthened inter-institutional dialogue at EU level with both the European Parliament and the Council: The Commission will engage with the European Parliament before each key stage of the European Semester. The Commission will also continue to contribute to the Recovery and Resilience Dialogues with the Parliament and maintain regular exchanges in a dedicated Parliament Working Group on the RRF.The Macroeconomic Dialogue at political and technical level between the Council, the Commission and representatives of the European social partners already provides a platform for continuous exchange on social and economic developments in the European Union. This format has already been used to discuss the European Semester as well as the RRF. Systematic involvement of social partners and other relevant stakeholders is key for a successful coordination and implementation of socio-economic policies. For the implementation of RRPs and to ensure national ownership of these plans, it is also important that Member States engage actively with social partners and other stakeholders on the broader socio-economic coordination agenda.\", \"What is the future of the European Semester in the context of the debate on the economic governance review?\": \"The economic governance review, relaunched in October 2021, is ongoing. It aims to help achieve a broad consensus on how to improve the effectiveness of economic surveillance and policy coordination. The European Semester will remain the reference framework for integrated surveillance and the coordination of EU economic and employment policies. In the coming years, we will return to a more regular cycle of economic policy coordination and coherently integrate the implementation of the RRPs, as well as the fast-forwarding of the green and digital transition and the need to enhance economic and social resilience. In the 2022 European Semester cycle, the Commission will resume preparing country reports, which assess country-specific challenges and take stock of progress with a view to proposing country-specific recommendations.\", \"How did the Commission assess the 2022 Draft Budgetary Plans?\": \"The Commission's Opinions on the 2022 DBPs focus on their consistency with the Council Recommendations of June 2021: Member States with low or medium levels of debt should pursue a supportive fiscal stance.Member States with a high level of debt should use the RRF to finance additional investment in support of the recovery while pursuing a prudent fiscal policy.All Member States should preserve nationally financed investment.Growth of nationally financed current expenditure should be kept under control, and be limited for Member States with high debt.All Member States should pay particular attention to the quality of budgetary measures to ensure a sustainable and inclusive recovery.\", \"What are the main conclusions of the assessment of the 2022 Draft Budgetary Plans?\": \"Member States are unwinding the temporary emergency measures and increasingly focusing support measures on sustaining the recovery. RRF grants will in 2022 fund 24% of total recovery support measures. The absorption of RRF grants is set to be frontloaded: Member States are expected to spend over 40% of the total amount of allocated RRF grants, pending the decision to disburse following the fulfilment of the milestones and targets. Nationally financed investment is planned to be preserved or broadly preserved in 2022 in all Member States, as recommended by the Council. The euro area fiscal stance is projected to be expansionary over the 2020-2022 period. The positive contribution coming from public investment and other capital spending financed by both the national and EU budgets is important, but the main driver of the fiscal expansion in 2021 and 2022 is nationally financed net current primary expenditure. In several Member States including some high-debt ones, the projected supportive fiscal stance is set to be driven by higher nationally financed current spending, or by unfunded tax cuts. In some cases, this is expected to have a sizeable impact on the underlying fiscal position. In about a quarter of Member States the supportive fiscal stance is expected to be driven by investment, both nationally and EU financed. Specifically: High-debt Member States (Belgium, France, Greece, Italy and Spain) As recommended by the Council, all Member States use the RRF to finance additional investment in support of the recovery.As recommended by the Council, all Member States preserve nationally financed investment.Italy has been recommended by the Council to limit the growth of nationally financed current expenditure. This is not projected to be sufficiently ensured, as the growth of nationally financed primary current expenditure (net of new revenue measures) in 2022 is projected to provide a sizeable contribution to Italy's overall supportive fiscal stance. In order to contribute to the pursuit of a prudent fiscal policy, the Commission invites Italy to take the necessary measures within the national budgetary process to limit the growth of nationally financed current expenditure.For Belgium, France, Greece, Italy and Spain, given the level of their government debt and high sustainability challenges in the medium term before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, when taking supporting budgetary measures, it is important to preserve prudent fiscal policy in order to ensure sustainable public finances in the medium term. Low/medium debt Member States (Austria, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Slovakia) As recommended by the Council, all Member States, with the exception of Slovakia and Malta, pursue a supportive fiscal stance, including the impulse provided by the RRF. Slovakia's restrictive fiscal stance occurs against the background of high output growth and emerging capacity constraints. Malta's neutral stance reflects mainly very high estimated potential growth, while public investment reaches a historically high level. This is broadly as recommended by the Council.All Member States plan to use the RRF to support their recovery, while the Netherlands has not yet submitted its Recovery and Resilience Plan.As recommended by the Council, all Member States preserve or broadly preserve nationally financed investment.Latvia and Lithuania have been recommended by the Council to control the growth of nationally financed current expenditure. This is not projected to be sufficiently ensured, as the growth of nationally financed primary current expenditure (net of new revenue measures) in 2022 is projected to provide a sizeable contribution to their overall supportive fiscal stance.\", \"Why is there no Opinion on Portugal's Draft Budgetary Plan?\": \"The Commission did not adopt an Opinion on the DBP submitted by Portugal, as the Portuguese Parliament rejected the 2022 budget on which Portugal's DBP was based. Portugal's incoming government is expected to submit an updated DBP to the Commission once it takes office.\", \"What is the euro area recommendation?\": \"The euro area recommendation presents tailored advice to euro area Member States on those topics that affect the functioning of the euro area as a whole. The recommendation reviews fiscal, financial and structural issues, as well as institutional aspects of Europe's Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).\", \"What is contained in the euro area recommendation?\": \"The euro area recommendation, which applies to the period 2022-23, calls for euro area Member States to take action individually and collectively to address key current policy challenges and work towards a sustainable recovery. More specifically, the recommendation calls for: Maintaining a moderately supportive fiscal stance in 2022 across the euro area and gradually pivoting fiscal policy measures towards investments Promoting policies that ensure fair and efficient tax systems, including through the implementation of the global consensus-based solution to address tax challenges arising from a digital and global economy. Transitioning from emergency to recovery measures in labour markets, ensuring effective active labour market policiesMonitoring the effectiveness of policy support packages for companies and focusing on targeted support for the solvency of viable firms.Further strengthening national institutional frameworks and pursuing reforms to address bottlenecks to investment and reallocation of capitalSupporting macrofinancial stability and credit channels to the economy, in particular through progress in completing the Banking Union, strengthening the international role of the euro and continued support for the creation of a digital euro.\", \"What are the next steps following the presentation of the 2021 euro area recommendation?\": \"The Council will have to formally adopt the Recommendation, based on this Commission's proposal. The Commission's proposal for the euro area recommendation will be presented at the Economic and Financial Affairs Council in December before being discussed by the Eurogroup next January. Endorsement by the European Council is expected in March 2022 with formal adoption by the Economic and Financial Affairs Council later in 2022. Member States should take action based on the Recommendation both individually and collectively within the Eurogroup to implement the euro area recommendation in the period 2022 \\u2013 2023.\", \"What is the Alert Mechanism Report?\": \"This Alert Mechanism Report (AMR) initiates the eleventh round of the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP) to detect, prevent and correct imbalances that hinder the proper functioning of Member States' economies, the economic and monetary union or the Union as a whole, and at eliciting appropriate policy responses. The AMR identifies Member States for which in-depth reviews (IDRs) should be undertaken to assess whether they are experiencing macroeconomic imbalances. The AMR analysis is based on the economic reading of a scoreboard of agreed indicators.\", \"What are the main findings of the Alert Mechanism Report?\": \"The AMR concludes that IDRs should be prepared for 12 Member States to identify and assess the severity of possible macroeconomic imbalances. The Member States identified are: Croatia, Cyprus, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Spain, and Sweden \\u2013 the same ones that had already been identified as having imbalances or excessive imbalances in the previous MIP cycle. The new IDRs will assess how those imbalances have developed, analysing their gravity, evolution and the policy response delivered by Member States, to update existing assessments and to assess possible remaining policy needs. In addition, the AMR finds that, while the balance of risks does not at present point to a need for an IDR, some Member States display developments that merit particular attention: Slovakia is marked by strong house price growth alongside an increase in household borrowing. Exports are markedly concentrated in a few specific sectors and there have been cost competitiveness losses, but export market shares have so far not been adversely affected.In Hungary, the interplay between government borrowing and external financing in a context of significant debt exposure in foreign currency merits attention.In Denmark, Luxembourg and Czechia risks linked to the housing market must be monitored.In Malta, growing private debt combined with weaknesses of the insolvency framework, create particular vulnerabilities as crisis support measures are phased out.\", \"What are the next steps following the presentation of the Alert Mechanism Report?\": \"Discussions on the AMR with the European Parliament and within the Council and the Eurogroup will focus on the horizontal findings of the report. The Commission will in the coming months prepare IDRs for the Member States concerned. The IDRs will be published in spring 2022, and will provide the basis for the Commission assessment regarding the existence or unwinding of macroeconomic imbalances, and to what extent policies are addressing these challenges.\", \"What are the findings of the enhanced surveillance report for Greece?\": \"The Commission has published the twelfth report for Greece under the Enhanced Surveillance framework that was activated following the conclusion of the financial assistance programme in August 2018. The report concludes that Greece has further progressed towards achieving its specific commitments, despite delays encountered in some areas, that are partly linked to the challenging circumstances caused by the pandemic or the catastrophic wildfires in August 2021. The authorities delivered on specific commitments in the energy sector and public financial management, while making important and welcome steps towards completion of most of its specific commitments by April 2022. The European institutions welcome the close and constructive engagement in all areas and encourage the authorities to keep up the momentum and remedy the delays in particular as concerns financial sector reforms, arrears clearance, health care and justice. The report could serve as a basis for the Eurogroup to decide on the release of the next set of policy-contingent debt measures.\", \"What are the main findings of the post-programme surveillance reports for Spain, Portugal, Cyprus and Ireland?\": \"The post-programme surveillance reports for Spain, Portugal, Cyprus and Ireland find that all four Member States retain their capacity to service their outstanding debt. In the case of Cyprus, economic activity started recovering from the sharp recession as of the first half of 2021, driven mainly by domestic demand, although tourism activity still remains well below the pre-pandemic level. While the fiscal situation continues to reflect the impact of the pandemic on the economy and sizeable fiscal support measures, public finances are expected to improve in the next years. The banking sector is weathering the COVID crisis rather well and work continues on reducing non-performing loans. Cyprus enjoyed a supportive market environment when tapping the international markets, continues to have a sizeable liquidity buffer and benefits from \\u2018investment grade' ranking by three major rating agencies. In the case of Spain, economic recovery is gaining traction. Support measures at national and European level have underpinned a recovery of the labour market and buffered the effects of the crisis in the corporate sector. Moreover, continued economic growth and a broad implementation of the RRP will help reduce the deficit and the debt over the forecast horizon. Nonetheless, certain challenges for the economy lie ahead as risks to this outlook are slightly tilted to the downside in the short term. The Spanish banking sector has remained resilient during the pandemic, as loan moratoria have alleviated the impact of the pandemic on banks and borrowers. Portugal's economy in the second quarter of 2021 outperformed expectations after a weak start of the year. It is expected to continue growing at a considerable pace, reaching its pre-pandemic output level in mid-2022. Portugal's fiscal policy has provided targeted support and cushioned against the negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Its public finances are expected to benefit from the economic recovery as of 2021, amid a wind-down of fiscal support and revived momentum in public investment. The banking sector confirmed its resilience to the pandemic shock while adjusting to risks related to the expiration of the credit moratoria at the end of September 2021. Ireland avoided a recession in 2020 and is on track to record very strong growth in 2021. This growth is driven by exports of multinational corporations headquartered in Ireland as well as by the domestic recovery. Government support measures counteracted the socio-economic impact of the pandemic, but increased the deficit and debt stock over 2020 and 2021. Ireland's financial sector has remained resilient to the impact of the pandemic.\", \"What are the main findings of the Communication on the fiscal situation in Romania?\": \"Romania has been under the excessive deficit procedure (EDP) since April 2020 due to the breach of the Treaty deficit threshold in 2019. The trend of rising public deficits was driven by expansionary measures that were adopted before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The June 2021 Council recommendation to Romania requires Romania to bring an end to its excessive deficit by 2024 at the latest. The Romanian authorities submitted their report on action taken in response to the Recommendation in October. The report shows that, for 2021, the headline budget balance is compliant with the recommended target, while the fiscal effort is expected to fall short of the requirements. At the same time, the targets for 2022-2024 are currently not projected to be met on a no-policy-change basis, indicating the need for a medium-term consolidation strategy and corresponding corrective measures. In its Autumn 2021 Economic Forecast, the Commission projects Romania's deficit at 8% of GDP in 2021 and to slowly decrease in subsequent years, but not enough to meet the recommended targets under the EDP. In light of the compliance of the headline budget balance target for 2021, and of the caretaker nature of the government when Romania submitted the effective action report, the Commission considers that no decision on further steps in Romania's excessive deficit procedure should be taken at this juncture. The Commission will reassess Romania's budgetary situation after the new government has presented a budget for 2022 and a medium-term fiscal strategy.\", \"Is the Commission concerned by the impact of inflation on the recovery and how should this affect economic policies in the EU and the euro area?\": \"The increase in inflation in 2021 is primarily driven by the surge in energy prices, but appears also linked to a broad set of post-pandemic economic adjustments, suggesting that the current elevated levels are largely transitory. Inflation may turn out higher than forecast if supply constraints are more persistent and above-productivity wage increases are passed on to consumer prices. The Commission will continue to closely monitor developments for signs that the increase in inflation may be more sustained or become structural. Economic policies should remain agile and reflect the evolving economic situation. Despite the improved economic and health outlook, the recovery remains fragile and policy support is still needed. While this support should be targeted and limited in time, its phasing out should not be precipitated either, in reaction to transient upside pressures on inflation.\", \"What is the Proposal for a Joint Employment Report?\": \"The Joint Employment Report provides an annual overview of the main employment and social developments in the EU. In addition, the Joint Employment Report 2022 monitors Member States' performance in relation to the Social Scoreboard accompanying the European Pillar of Social Rights.\", \"What is new in this year's Joint Employment Report?\": \"This edition of the Joint Employment Report has a stronger focus on the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights, in line with the commitments of the Action Plan of March 2021 and the 8 May Porto Declaration. The focus on the Pillar is strengthened by analysing key challenges related to its implementation, notably on: Active support to employmentAdult learning for inclusive and sustainable growthJob quality and \\u2018quality of life at work'Combatting social exclusion and providing support to childrenAccess to adequate social protectionLong-term care. The report integrates the three EU headline targets on employment, skills and poverty reduction by 2030, which were put forward by the Commission in the Pillar Action Plan and welcomed by EU leaders at the Porto Social Summit in May and by the European Council in June 2021. The revised Social Scoreboard underpins the analysis in this year's Joint Employment Report. The updated set of indicators captures important dimensions like adult learning, labour market integration of persons with disabilities, children's risk of poverty or social exclusion, and housing costs. As part of the policy response analysis, the JER also includes a selection of measures supported by the RRF and other EU funding sources, including the European Social Fund Plus.\", \"What are the main findings of the proposal for a Joint Employment Report?\": \"The labour market is recovering, although employment is not yet back to pre-crisis levels. In the second quarter of 2021, the total number of people in employment in the EU reached 207.5 million. This is 4.1 million more than in the second quarter of 2020, but still 2 million below the peak of the fourth quarter of 2019. Overall, the increase in unemployment as compared to the pre-COVID-19 situation remained below what could have been expected. This is thanks to the policy measures introduced by Member States, notably short-time work schemes. These actions were supported by EU funding (notably SURE but also REACT-EU and the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative, CRII and CRII plus). The analysis confirms that the crisis affected in particular young people, workers in non-standard forms of employment, the self-employed and third-country nationals. It also highlighted long-standing challenges for women in the labour market, particularly regarding care obligations and hours worked. Social protection systems helped weather the COVID-19 crisis, contributing to keeping households' disposable incomes broadly stable. Nonetheless, poverty and social exclusion risks remain high for certain population groups, and in particular families with children, persons with disabilities, people born outside the EU and Roma. For people experiencing poverty, housing and energy costs pose a particular challenge. The Commission encourages Member States to address the employment, skills and social policy challenges identified, making full use of EU funding possibilities. They should in particular support job creation, ease transitions from unemployment into employment and between jobs (including across sectors), strengthen economic and social resilience and ensure that the green and digital transitions are fair and inclusive. Such measures should also help to progress towards the European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan's three 2030 EU headline targets on employment, skills and poverty reduction.\", \"What are the next steps following the presentation of a Joint Employment Report?\": \"The proposal for a Joint Employment Report will now be discussed in two advisory bodies of the Council: the Employment Committee and the Social Protection Committee, with a view to final adoption by the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) in March 2022.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6221\": {\"Why it is important to involve transport operators in combatting transnational organised crime, the smuggling and trafficking of persons?\": \"As such illegal activities very often take place using transport, it is necessary to closely involve transport operators in combatting these activities. Several initiatives have already been launched at international level. ICAO adopted Circular 357 with \\u2018Guidelines for Reporting Trafficking in Persons by Flight and Cabin Crew' and Circular 352 with \\u2018Guidelines for Training Cabin Crew on Identifying and Responding to Trafficking in Persons'. According to these circulars, States' Civil Aviation Authorities should require operators to develop policies, procedures, training and guidance for their employees on these matters. IATA also issued a Resolution against trafficking persons in 2018, and developed guidance material for its members. The IMO published interim measures for combating unsafe practices associated with the trafficking, smuggling or transport of migrants by sea. The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) has issued guidance on ensuring the safety and security of seafarers and rescued persons.\", \"Why do we need new EU legislation to tackle this issue?\": \"It is essential to closely involve transport operators in preventing and combatting trafficking and smuggling. Many transport operators already have policies in place to avoid becoming an accessory to crime. The international transport organisations and industry associations have developed Guidance material for their members (cf. reply to question 2). Moreover, participating in such activities or facilitating them may constitute criminal offenses under national provisions implementing the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. However, such policies and national legislation are not universal, and where they do exist, they are not always well implemented. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the EU has the appropriate tools to combat migrant smuggling and its instrumentalisation for political purposes, and to tackle human trafficking. This requires more targeted legislation directly addressing transport operators that engage in such operations or other serious crimes to facilitate the illegal entry into the EU.\", \"Which transport operators are targeted by this Regulation?\": \"This Regulation lays down rules to prevent and counter the use of commercial transport to facilitate and engage in the smuggling of migrants or trafficking of people. In particular, it identifies measures that may be taken to prevent or restrict the activities of transport operators who, in relation to the illegal entry of such migrants and persons into the territory of the Union, either: (a) use transport means in the commission of smuggling of migrants or trafficking in persons; or(b) with knowledge of (i) either the aim and general criminal activity of an organised criminal group active in smuggling of migrants or trafficking in persons or of (ii) its intention to commit those crimes, take an active part in the criminal activities of such a group; or(c) organise, direct, aid, abet, facilitate or counsel the commission of smuggling of migrants or trafficking of people involving an organised criminal group.\", \"How will the Commission apply the Regulation?\": \"The effectiveness of measures largely requires swift action. Where a transport operator facilitates or engages in the smuggling of migrants or trafficking of people, the Commission may adopt an implementing act identifying measures against that transport operator. These measures will be based on the available evidence, and may be applied after the transport operators have exercised their right to be heard. The implementing act will apply immediately after its adoption by the Commission. Within 14 days from the adoption, the Commission will consult the committee of representatives of Member States. If the committee issues a negative opinion the Commission should immediately repeal the implementing act in question. Measures taken against transport operators under this Regulation should be made public, and will therefore be published without delay in the Official Journal of the European Union. Transport operators should also bring the measures to the attention of passengers. The measures will not affect the rights of passengers under EU legislation.\", \"What measures may the Commission impose against transport operators?\": \"The preventive and protective measures against transport operators may include: preventing any further expansion of, or limiting current transport operations in the Union market;suspending the right to provide transport services from, to or within the EU;suspending the right to fly over EU territory;suspending the right to refuel or carry out maintenance within the EU;suspending the right to call into and enter EU ports;suspending the right to transit through EU territory;suspending licences and authorisations granted under Union law allowing operation within the Union or the international carriage of passengers. The measures may cover any mode of transport (land, air, inland waterways and sea) that engages in, or facilitates, smuggling or trafficking of human beings into the European Union.Also, the measures should be necessary and proportionate in view of the particular circumstances of each case.\", \"How long should these measures stay in place?\": \"The period of application of those measures shall not exceed one year. The measures shall be reviewed where necessary and may also be renewed.\", \"What about transport operators acting outside the EU?\": \"In accordance with international conventions, this Regulation allows adopting measures to prevent or restrict the activities of transport operators in relation to the illegal entry of migrants and persons into the territory of the European Union.\", \"Are EU passenger rights affected by this Regulation?\": \"This Regulation does not affect EU passenger rights. In particular, and in case the Commission has taken measures against a transport operator, the affected passengers maintain their rights to reimbursement, re-routing and care. Moreover, the cancellation of transport operations due to the application of measures taken by the Commission should not be considered as extraordinary circumstances, which means that the passengers maintain their right to compensation.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_6093\": {\"What are PCIs?\": \"Projects of common interest (PCIs) are key infrastructure projects aimed at completing the European internal energy market in order to help the EU achieve its energy and climate policy objectives: delivering affordable, secure and sustainable energy for all Europeans and contributing to a climate-neutral economy by 2050.\", \"Which projects are on the PCI list?\": \"The 5th PCI list includes 98 projects: 67 electricity transmission and storage projects, 20 gas projects (listed previously in the fourth PCI list), six CO2 network projects and five smart grid projects. The full list of projects can be found here.\", \"Which criteria does a project have to meet to be included on the PCI lists?\": \"Under the current TEN-E Regulation, for a project to become a PCI it should be an energy network infrastructure that has a significant impact on at least two EU Member States and contributes to at least one of the following policy objectives: a) enhances market integration and contributes to the integration of Member States' networks, b) increases competition on energy markets by offering alternatives to consumers, c) enhances security of supply, d) contributes to the sustainability objective, e.g. by supporting renewable generation and CO2 reduction. In line with the existing trans-European energy networks (TEN-E) Regulation, only those electricity and gas projects that are included in the latest Ten-Year-Network Development Plans (TYNDPs) prepared by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for gas and for electricity (ENTSOG and ENTSO-E) can become PCIs, as these Plans highlight the projects' socio-economic benefits for the EU energy system. The Commission has proposed a revision of the TEN-E Regulation which would exclude support for oil and gas infrastructure in future PCI lists, and create an obligation for all projects to meet mandatory sustainability criteria as well as to follow the \\u2018do no significant harm' principle as set out in the Green Deal. However, this Regulation is still going through the legislative process in the European Parliament and Council, so the Commission is bound to use the existing legal basis for the fifth PCI list.\", \"What are the benefits of being on the list?\": \"PCIs benefit from a number of advantages: a) streamlined permit granting procedures (a binding three-and-a-half-year time limit); b) improved, faster and better streamlined environmental assessment; c) a single national competent authority (one-stop-shop) coordinating all permit granting procedures; d) a procedure allowing for the allocation of investment (construction) costs among Member States benefiting from the PCI; e) eligibility for financial assistance under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) in the form of grants and innovative financial instruments. It should be noted that there is no guarantee of EU financing for projects on the PCI list.\", \"The fourth PCI list contained 149 projects. Why are there fewer projects this year?\": \"The fifth PCI list reflects the evolving policy priorities related to meeting the EU's climate neutrality goals and the clean energy transition: it does not contain any new gas infrastructure projects, nor any oil projects and, thus, firmly shifts the priority to infrastructure most supportive of the EU's decarbonisation aims. With regard to electricity, the list contains 61 transmission and six storage projects. The projects have been selected with the aim to fill the remaining infrastructure gaps and allow for a smooth transition towards climate neutrality. The lower number compared to the 100 projects included on the fourth PCI list can be explained by the completion (or near completion) of 14 interconnection projects and by the change in status of the UK from a Member State to a third country, which led to the ineligibility of 12 projects which had been on the fourth list. Electricity interconnections are key to achieving the 2030 targets and the climate-neutrality objective at the least cost for society. The Commission put an even stronger focus on electricity transmission in the proposal for a revised TEN-E Regulation, notably through dedicated provisions that would allow for an ambitious scale-up of offshore grids across sea-basins in Europe. We expect to see more of these projects in future PCI lists once the new rules enter into force. The number of gas PCIs is reduced from 32 projects in the previous list to 20. These projects are necessary to ensure security of supply for all Member States. Once these advanced projects are completed, there is no longer need to support gas projects with PCI status. No new gas infrastructure projects are supported by today's proposal. This underlines the robustness and resilience of the existing EU gas grid, as well as the EU's resolve to phase out support for fossil fuel infrastructure. The low number of gas projects on the list is also the result of the strengthened sustainability assessment applied to candidate PCIs in gas. The list includes five smart grid projects and six CO2 network projects. Their relative importance as a share of all projects on the PCI list is expected to grow and these projects are expected to play an increasing role in the future.\", \"Why are there still fossil fuel projects in the fifth PCI list?\": \"The Commission is committed to aligning all of its energy and climate legislation with the objectives of the Green Deal. Last December, we presented a proposal for a revision of the TEN-E Regulation, which would no longer allow oil and natural gas infrastructure to become Projects of Common Interest (PCIs). This policy shift mirrors the achievements of the TEN-E policy in securing a robust and shock resilient infrastructure and the uptake of renewable gases. It would also oblige all future projects on the PCI list to meet mandatory sustainability criteria. In the meantime, the Commission is required by law to present the fifth list of PCI projects by the end of this year based on the current TEN-E Regulation, which includes in its scope natural gas infrastructure. Natural gas is a transition fuel and we should make sure that the infrastructure which transports natural gas today also serves our Green Deal and energy security goals in the future. Today it replaces more polluting and CO2 intensive fuels such as coal, oil shale and peat. It also serves as a flexibility provider in the EU energy system, backing-up the renewable energy production and contributing to energy security. Until the new TEN-E rules are in place, to the extent the current framework allowed for it, the Commission has strived to ensure the alignment of the 5th PCI list with the Green Deal objectives. The strict assessment of infrastructure needs across the EU and strengthened sustainability assessment applied to candidate PCIs in gas has led to a further reduction of gas projects on the list, from 32 to 20. The list contains no new natural gas projects, all of the projects included were already in the fourth PCI list.\", \"How was the sustainability of projects assessed in the fifth PCI list?\": \"The Commission has worked very closely with all stakeholders in the process, including ENTSO-G, ACER, and the TEN-E Regional Group members, to strengthen the sustainability assessment of candidate projects in gas infrastructure and align the process with our Green Deal objectives. A study for the Commission on the sustainability impact of gas infrastructure was finalised in June 2020. This study looked at the shortcomings of the existing ENTSO-G sustainability indicator and proposed ways for its improvement. The Commission has used the recommendations of this study to improve the PCI assessment  methodology for assessing gas projects for the fifth PCI list. All gas candidate projects have been subject to this assessment. First, the methodology allows for either a positive or negative net impact assessment on CO2 emissions. A project can show positive CO2 savings when gas replaces coal or oil. However, if the main effect of the project is to lead to increased natural gas consumption rather than phasing out more polluting sources, it will result in a negative assessment. Second, the allocation of CO2 savings (if there are any) to individual gas projects is based on actual gas flows and infrastructure use. The method prioritises the use of already existing infrastructure over the new assets. If the increased gas demand can be met by existing infrastructure, the project in question shows no sustainability benefit. The sustainability indicator focuses on CO2 impact but it also includes an assessment of a project's impact on air quality (i.e. non-GHG emissions, such as NOx, SOx and particulate matter). The Commission's proposal for a revised TEN-E Regulation, tabled last December, makes the sustainability assessment mandatory for all projects, meaning that no project would be eligible for PCI status unless it can prove a significant contribution to this criterion.\", \"Will the projects on the list automatically get EU funds?\": \"Projects selected as PCIs can automatically benefit from many advantages stemming from the TEN-E Regulation, including an accelerated permit granting and improved regulatory treatment. However, while PCI status is a precondition for grants under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), it does not guarantee the award of a CEF grant. All PCIs can apply for grants to support studies. However, when it comes to grants for works, only some projects included on the PCI list will need \\u2013 and will be eligible for - financial assistance; many of them can be implemented on a commercial basis without EU funds or other public subsidies. Projects selected as PCIs, upon meeting specific additional criteria, will be able to apply for the CEF support in a separate procedure.\", \"When will PCIs be able to apply for EU funding?\": \"The next call for proposals for PCIs to receive grants under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) is planned for the first half of 2022. Project promoters will be able to apply for grants for studies and for construction works. Grants for works, however, will be available only to those PCIs that are not commercially viable despite their positive impacts, such as solidarity, security of supply or technological innovation. An objective cost-benefit analysis will be used to determine these parameters. In addition to CEF funding, PCIs can also apply for support under other EU programmes, such as the European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI), and the European Structural & Investment Funds (ESIF), in particular the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).\", \"Which projects have received co-funding under CEF?\": \"In the 2014-2020 budget period, 107 PCIs have benefited from the CEF programme. The allocated grants for works and studies are worth \\u20ac4.7 billion in total. When allocating CEF Energy financial assistance, the Commission has given particular consideration to electricity projects, with the aim of making the major part of the CEF Energy financial assistance available to these projects over the period 2014 \\u2013 2020. So far, the majority of CEF financial assistance has been allocated to electricity projects (including smart grids), which represent around 65% of total funding, double the amount dedicated to gas infrastructure.\", \"When will the next (sixth) PCI list be adopted?\": \"The TEN-E Regulation stipulates that the Commission adopts every two years the Union list of PCIs in the form of a delegated act. Subject to the timely conclusion of the co-legislation process, the revised TEN-E Regulation will be the legal base for the adoption of the sixth Union list of PCIs, which is planned to take place by the end of 2023. The Commission proposal for the revised TEN-E Regulation maintains the legal provision to adopt the Union list of PCIs every two years.\", \"How is the PCI list established?\": \"In a first stage, promoters submit their projects for selection as PCIs. After that, so-called Regional Groups (chaired by the Commission and including representatives from the Member States, transmission system operators and their European networks, project promoters, national regulatory authorities, as well as the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER)) assess the projects' compliance with the criteria and their European added value. Stakeholders are invited to take part in these meetings and bring their insight on infrastructure bottlenecks and on the candidate PCIs. Based on this assessment, the Regional Groups propose regional lists of PCI candidates. The Commission then adopts the final draft list of PCIs, in the form of a delegated regulation.\", \"What are the next steps?\": \"Published as a delegated act, the list of PCIs will be submitted by the Commission to the European Parliament and Council, who have two months to decide whether to accept or object to the list. This period of two months may be extended by an additional two months upon their request. If within this timeframe neither the Parliament nor the Council rejects the list, it will enter into force. It should be noted that Parliament or Council can only accept or reject the list as such, but not request amendments to it.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_5918\": {\"Why is the EU revising the rules on waste shipments?\": \"Waste can be a valuable resource but it has to be used with care. When waste shipped across borders is not properly controlled and sustainably managed in the destination countries, it can harm human health and the environment. On the other hand, such waste can have a positive economic value and also bring environmental benefits. This is the case when it is recycled and used as secondary materials, therefore replacing virgin materials and contributing to a more circular economy. International trade in waste is on the rise, and the EU plays a significant role in it. The Waste Shipment Regulation currently in force dates back to 2006. Since its adoption, exports of waste from the EU to third countries have considerably increased, notably to countries that are not members of the OECD. The lack of detailed provisions to ensure that waste is managed sustainably in the countries of destination has led to weak enforcement and environmental and public health challenges in those countries. In 2020, the EU exported around 33 million tonnes of waste to non-EU countries and imported around 16 million tonnes. In addition, nearly 70 million tonnes of waste are shipped between EU countries each year. Administrative procedures limit the circulation of waste between EU Member States and this in turn is slowing down the move to a circular economy at EU scale. Another significant problem is that illegal traders widely bypass existing rules, resulting in environmental crime in the EU and in third countries. Organised criminal groups increasingly focus on lucrative waste crime largely using legal business structures to perpetrate their activities. Coordinated enforcement campaigns indicate that between 15% and 30% of waste shipments might be illegal, amounting to EUR 9.5 billion annual revenues from the illicit waste market in the EU. Overall, these developments have exposed the fragility of a business model where the export of waste outside the EU has become a common way of dealing with some waste streams generated in the EU. To address all these issues, this proposal for a new Regulation puts forward a new approach to address EU shipments of waste, implementing the commitments of the European Green Deal, the new Circular Economy Action Plan and the Zero Pollution Action Plan and the new EU Strategy to tackle Organised Crime 2021-2025.\", \"What does the Commission aim to achieve with this proposal?\": \"The new Waste Shipment Regulation has three goals: ensuring that the EU does not export its waste challenges to third countries; making it easier to transport waste for recycling and reuse in the EU; and better tackling illegal waste shipments. This will ensure that the EU does not export its pollution abroad and  waste is treated in a sustainable way, within and outside the EU, while supporting the move to an innovative circular economy. The proposed measures will impose high standards for waste management in third countries importing waste from the EU, which can bring environmental and economic benefits for these countries. These measures will also reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to meeting climate targets, as they will encourage the uptake of recycled materials in the EU, which have a much lower carbon footprint than primary raw materials (such as coal, iron ore, bauxite, pulp, and oil) currently used by EU industry. A major reason for EU dependence on exports of some waste is that the EU generates too much waste. This proposal on waste shipments fits together with the overall EU objective in the European Green Deal to reduce the generation of waste. In the coming months, the Commission will propose additional new rules to achieve this objective, including regulating the design of packaging and other products to ensure that they do not result in waste that is impossible to re-use or recycle.\", \"What are the main measures of the proposal on the export of waste?\": \"To ensure that the export of waste from the EU to third countries is managed sustainably, the following measures are proposed: For countries that are not members of the OECD, exports of waste from the EU would be made conditional on an official request from the country to import non-hazardous waste from the EU and demonstration that it can recover it in a sound manner. A list of countries authorised to import waste from the EU will be set up.The Commission will monitor the levels of waste exports from the EU to OECD countries. If there is a surge in waste exports to one of these countries, risking serious environmental or public health problems in that country, the Commission will seek information on the treatment of this waste in the country concerned. The Commission will suspend export of this waste if there is no guarantee that this treatment is sustainable.EU exporting companies would have to carry out independent audits for their waste exports outside the EU. These audits should demonstrate that the facilities treat this waste in an environmentally sound manner. EU companies would only be authorised to export to these facilities if this is the case.To address waste being illegally presented as \\u201cused goods\\u201d, specific binding criteria will be developed to differentiate between waste and used goods for specific commodities of a particular concern, such as used vehicles and batteries.\", \"What are the main measures on shipments of waste between EU Member States?\": \"The following measures are proposed on the shipments of waste between EU Member States to unlock the potential of the EU waste market and boost the circular economy: A full digitalisation of all procedures governing the shipments of waste between EU Member States, in particular for \\u201cgreen-listed\\u201d waste;New provisions to support the use of fast-track procedures for shipments of waste destined to recovery, when they are destined to facilities certified by the EU Member States (\\u201cpre-consented facilities\\u201d);Harmonised classification of waste at the EU level, to help overcome the current fragmentation of the EU market, where a shipment of waste can be subject to different interpretations and procedures when crossing borders in the EU;New provisions making it possible to streamline at the EU level the calculation of financial guarantees that operators have to establish before shipping \\u201cnotified\\u201d waste abroad;New and stricter conditions for shipments of waste for incineration or landfilling, so that they are only authorised in limited and well-justified cases, as they are the least preferred options for the management of waste.\", \"What are the main measures to tackle illegal shipments of waste?\": \"The following measures are proposed to tackle illegal shipments of waste and reduce environmental crime: The European Commission will support transnational investigations by EU Member States on waste trafficking, with the help of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), which has the relevant expertise. This will strengthen the overall enforcement capacity of the EU and its Member States and ensure more efficient use of the often limited resources for enforcement.An EU \\u2018waste shipment enforcement group' would be established to increase cooperation and coordination against illegal shipments of waste. This group would comprise environmental, customs, police and other relevant national inspection authorities, as well as European and international law enforcement networks.Current rules on administrative penalties against illegal shipment of waste would be strengthened. Common criteria for determining the types and levels of penalties to be imposed for infringements would make penalties more deterrent and consistently applied across the EU. Member States should take these criteria into consideration when establishing penalties for offenders.A revision of the Environmental Crime Directive is planned, which will provide for dissuasive criminal sanction types. Financial support to projects designed to help enforcement agencies work together to tackle waste trafficking will be provided further on.\", \"Which waste streams are covered by the proposal?\": \"The proposal covers all types of waste. The proposal would make it easier to recycle and re-use hazardous and other \\u201cnotified\\u201d waste (non-hazardous waste subject to particular scrutiny, like mixed municipal waste and unsorted plastic waste) within the EU. There will be no major changes to the current rules on EU exports of such waste. The proposal contains important changes on the export of \\u201cgreen-listed\\u201d waste. This waste is not hazardous but its treatment can still cause major environmental pollution and harm public health. The evaluation of the current rules on waste shipments has shown that new rules are needed to avoid green-listed waste being exported from the EU to countries and facilities that are not equipped to manage them in an environmentally sound manner. The proposal does not establish new rules applying to the shipments of green-listed waste within the EU. However, it proposes that this waste should be more easily traceable; notably the documentation accompanying their circulation should be digitalised.\", \"What will happen to waste which, as a result of the proposed new rules, would stay in the EU rather than be exported?\": \"The aim of the proposal is to ensure that export only takes place when there are guarantees that the waste is managed in an environmentally sound manner. New measures on the export of waste will apply three years after the entry into force of the new Regulation, leaving sufficient time for preparing to direct waste streams to more sustainable treatment, but also for the transition to new business models and increasing the EU's overall capacity to deal with the waste generated in the EU. It is therefore expected that treating additional waste in the EU will not only benefit the environment, but will also represent opportunities to improve the competitiveness of EU industry and support the creation of new jobs in the circular economy. In particular, the impact assessment underpinning the proposal shows that there should be no major challenges for EU industry to process additional quantities of ferrous metal, non-ferrous metal and paper waste, which represent the highest share of waste currently exported outside the EU. The industries processing such waste (the steel, aluminium, copper, and paper industries) are already recycling substantial volumes and have the capacity to deal with additional quantities within the EU. Many industries are also planning investments to increase the uptake of waste in their production processes, which is a key feature of their decarbonisation strategy. The EU market for recycling plastic waste is undergoing a fundamental transition. This is driven by ambitious EU and national policies designed to reduce plastic pollution, increase recycled content and by significant investments in the plastic recycling sector, supported through the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility and Cohesion Policy Funds. These efforts should lead to a substantial increase in plastic recycling capacity in the coming years, allowing additional plastic waste to be recycled. The amount of textile waste generated in the EU has been increasing in recent years, as well as the export of such waste. There is currently limited recycling of textile waste in the EU but this will likely change in the future. In line with the European Green Deal and the Circular Economy Action Plan, the Commission plans to adopt a comprehensive Textile Strategy in 2022 to put the textile sector and its entire value chain on a more sustainable and circular path. This Strategy will consider regulatory measures to scale up the EU's recycling capacity. This, together with ongoing research and investments in new technologies for textile recycling, should improve waste treatment standards and practices in the EU.\", \"How will the EU work with international partners to address the problem globally?\": \"The EU will spearhead efforts at multilateral, regional and bilateral levels to render global trade in waste more sustainable, as well as to promote better waste management practices and the uptake of more circular models in the economies of our partner countries. The EU will lead initiatives to this end in multilateral organisations, starting with the UN Environmental Assembly in February 2022 and the Conference of the Parties of the Basel Convention in June 2022. The EU will especially promote the adoption of a new international agreement on plastics, and support actions to reduce pollution from e-waste, used vehicles and textile waste, which pose particular environmental challenges worldwide.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_5919\": {\"Why is the EU acting on global deforestation and forest degradation?\": \"The main driver of deforestation and forest degradation is the expansion of agricultural land, which is linked to the production of commodities we import such as soy, beef, palm oil, wood, cocoa and coffee. As a major economy and consumer of these commodities linked to deforestation and forest degradation, the EU is partly responsible for this problem \\u2014 and it wants to answer the strong call of European citizens to lead the way to solve it. The Commission therefore proposes a Regulation to mimimise EU-driven deforestation and forest degradation. By promoting the consumption of \\u2018deforestation-free' products and reducing the EU's impact on global deforestation and forest degradation, the new rules are expected to bring down greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss. The Open Public Consultation launched by the Commission for this legislative proposal gathered more than 1.2 million responses, the second most popular in the history of the EU, and showed overwhelming support from European citizens for EU action to tackle deforestation and forest degradation. Furthermore, the Standard Eurobarometer Survey of Spring 2021 shows EU citizens place the environment and climate change among the most important issues that their countries and they themselves personally face. This initiative will provide a guarantee to EU citizens that the products they consume on the EU market do not contribute to global deforestation and forest degradation. The proposal is part of a broader plan of actions to tackle deforestation and forest degradation first outlined in the 2019 Commission Communication on Stepping up EU Action to Protect and Restore the World's Forests. The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union too asked the Commission to swiftly come forward with effective legistlation [references in footnotes]. The EU pursues a comprehensive approach in which supply- and demand-side measures complement each other. It also involves, among other measures, multilateral engagement and dialogue with consumer and producer countries. Combatting deforestation will go hand in hand with creating incentives for a transition toward more sustainable use of the natural resources, contributing to preserving more intact forests, boosting market opportunities for sustainable products, and eliminating unfair competition from unsustainable producers exporting to the EU market. The Commission will also step up its dialogue with other big consumer countries join multilateral efforts to help halt global deforestation and forest degradation.\", \"How serious is the problem of deforestation?\": \"Deforestation and forest degradation are important drivers of global warming and biodiversity loss \\u2014 the two key environmental challenges of our time. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates that 420 million hectares of forest \\u2014 an area larger than the European Union \\u2014 were lost to deforestation between 1990 and 2020. In terms of net area loss (the difference between area of forest cleared and new surface of forests planted or regenerated), the FAO estimates that the world lost around 178 million hectares of forest cover in the same period of time, which is an area triple the size of France. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that 23% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (2007-2016) come from agriculture, forestry and other land uses. About 11% of overall emissions are from forestry and other land use, mostly deforestation, while the remaining 12% are direct emissions from agricultural production such as livestock and fertilizers.\", \"What are the main actions proposed in the Regulation?\": \"The Regulation sets mandatory due diligence rules for operators which place specific commodities on the EU market that are associated with deforestation and forest degradation\\u2013soy, beef, palm oil, wood, cocoa and coffee  and some derived products, such as leather, chocolate and furniture. Its purpose is to ensure that only deforestation-free and legal products (according to the laws of the country of origin) are allowed on the EU market. Operators will be required to collect the geographic coordinates of the land where the commodities they place on the market were produced. This strict traceability is meant to ensure that only deforestation-free products enter the EU market \\u2013 and that enforcement authorities in Member States have the necessary means to control that this is the case. A benchmarking system operated by the Commission will identify countries as presenting a low, standard or high risk of producing commodities or products that are not deforestation-free or in accordance with the legislation of the producer country. Obligations for operators and authorities will vary according to the level of risk of the country or region of production, with simplified due diligence duties for products coming from low-risk and enhanced scrutiny for high-risk areas. In addition, the Commission is committed to work with partner countries, including with governments, academia, private sector and civil society, to address deforestation and forest degradation. The Commission will also engage in international bilateral and multilateral discussion on policies and actions to halt deforestation and forest degradation, including in multilateral fora.\", \"What would be the main benefits from this Regulation?\": \"The aim of the new rules is to prevent deforestation and forest degradation. This would also mean a reduction of at least 31.9 million metric tons of carbon emissions to the atmosphere every year due to EU consumption and production of the relevant commodities, which could be translated into economic savings of at least \\u20ac 3.2 billion annually.\", \"How was the scope of the Regulation defined?\": \"Six commodities \\u2013 beef, wood, palm oil, soya, coffee and cocoa \\u2013 and some of their derived products \\u2013 for example leather, chocolate or furniture \\u2013 are included in the scope. These have been proposed based on the findings in the Impact Assessment of the initiative. This analysis aimed to select, building on scientific data and previous research, the commodities through which European production and consumption has been contributing the most to global deforestation and forest degradation. Based on the findings a cost-benefit analysis was conducted to further reduced the selection and define where an EU policy intervention could be more efficient. This selection was done objectively, treating equally commodities produced anywhere in the world, within or outside Europe. The Commission proposes a progressive scope of the commodities to be regulated, reviewing and updating the list regularly, taking into account new data. This will allow adapting it to changing deforestation patterns.\", \"Why is it important to tackle legal deforestation next to illegal?\": \"The initiative is groundbreaking, showing that the EU wants to lead by example: it takes a decisive step forward by moving beyond illegal deforestation to address any deforestation driven by agricultural expansion to produce the commodities in the scope of the regulation. The reasons are manifold. First, available evidence confirms that a part of deforestation is legal land use conversion according to the laws of the country of production. Second, focusing only on legality would make the Regulation rely on the stringency of third countries' rules, potentially encouraging a race to the bottom in countries highly dependent on agricultural exports that may be tempted to lower their environmental protection with a view to facilitating the access of their products to the EU market. Third, establishing a deforestation definition could facilitate the implementation of the rules and increase their effectiveness.\", \"How will the new rules be implemented, enforced and monitored? What is the role of geolocation?\": \"Companies placing the relevant commodities and products on the market will be required to put in place and implement due diligence systems to prevent the placing on the EU market of products linked to deforestation. They will be monitored and held accountable by enforcing authorities if they fail to comply with the requirements of the Regulation. Companies will need to submit a statement to a European information system confirming that they have successfully exercised due diligence and that the products they place on the market are compliant with EU rules. This statement will also provide essential information for monitoring, namely the geographical coordinates of the farm or plantation where the commodities were grown.\", \"How will the due diligence system work in practice?\": \"The new rules will require operators that place relevant commodities or products for the first time on the EU market to exercise due diligence in order to be able to ensure that: a) Those commodities and products have not been produced on land deforested or degraded after 31 December 2020; b) they have been produced in accordance with the laws of the country of production. Not meeting either of the two requirements will result in a prohibition to place those products on the EU market. As part of their due diligence systems, operators will have to go through three steps. As step one, they would need to ensure access to information on, amongst others, the commodity, quantity, supplier, country of production, etc. A key requirement, in this step, is to obtain the geographic coordinates of the plots of land where the commodities they place on the market were produced. As deforestation is linked to land-use change, monitoring deforestation requires a precise link between the commodity or product placed on the EU market and the plot of land where it was grown. Using geolocation coordinates is the simplest and most cost-effective way of obtaining the necessary geographic information for authorities to be in a position to check whether products and commodities are deforestation-free. Combining geolocation with remote monitoring via satellite images is expected to boost the effectiveness of the Regulation. In step two, companies will need to use the information on the plots of land used for producing the commodities to analyse and evaluate the risk in the supply chain. In step three, they will need to take adequate and proportionate mitigation measures.\", \"What impact will the new rules have on European companies?\": \"The Regulation sets common rules for any company \\u2013 from the EU or from abroad \\u2013 placing the products covered by the scope on the EU market. The Impact Assessment backing the proposal estimated the costs of compliance for companies to set up and operate their due diligence systems. These costs are lower than the expected benefits of the policy intervention. In addition, the proposal foresees long adaptation periods for enterprises, and specifically micro-enterprises, to be able to adapt to the changes required. Economic operators will be subject to the same requirements in order to clean up their supply chains from products provoking deforestation and forest degradation, fostering fair and sustainable market competition. The benchmarking system will facilitate the job of the operators by identifying low risk countries. Sourcing from those will only require simplified due diligence.\", \"What will the new rules mean for producers outside the EU?\": \"The Regulation will guarantee that domestic and imported commodities are measured by the same standards. There will be no ban of any country or any commodity. Sustainable producers will continue to be able to sell their goods to the EU. Demand for \\u2018deforestation-free' products is expected to grow in the EU \\u2013 thereby boosting sustainable businesses and business models across the world. \\u2018Deforestation-free' is defined as the condition of the goods produced on land that has not been subject to deforestation or forest degradation after December 31, 2020. Moreover, the new Regulation will be implemented hand in hand with other measures including support to producing countries. The Commission is proposing Forest Partnerships to help partner countries improve forest governance and create socio-economic opportunities for the populations through sustainable value chains.\", \"What will be the role of Member State competent authorities?\": \"EU Member States will be responsible for effective enforcement, ensuring that companies implement the Regulation properly. The proposal sets minimum inspection levels \\u2013 higher in the case of high-risk countries \\u2013 dissuasive sanctions, mandatory exchange of information between customs and other authorities, and an obligation for enforcing authorities to react to substantiated concerns raised by civil society. Member States authorities will be able to use a new digital system (\\u2018the Register') which will centralise relevant information on the commodities and products placed on the EU market, such as geographic coordinates and country of production, with a view to increasing the effectiveness of the policy intervention. Anonymized data of this system will be available to the wider public in order to foster transparency.\", \"How will the Commission support partner countries abroad to ensure the uptake of the new rules?\": \"Commission's approach to forests and forest communities is holistic and comprehensive, and advances sustainable development. The Commission has pledged \\u20ac 1 billion to facilitate protection, restoration and sustainable management of forests in the partner countries, for the benefit of people, climate and environment. The Commission is committed to help partners to reduce deforestation and forest degradation, by supporting them to strengthen forest governance, develop legislation and foster capacities. The Forest Partnerships, a new development cooperation tool, will tackle deforestation as one of its objectives. Acknowledging that one size does not fit all, Forest Partnerships will be tailor-made for partner country needs. Attention will also be paid to increase the transparency of supply chains, while taking into account the rights of forest dependent communities and indigenous peoples as well as smallholders' needs. In addition, the Commission will engage in bilateral and multilateral discussion on policies and actions to halt deforestation and forest degradation.\"}, \"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_5917\": {\"Why do we need to act on soils?\": \"Soil is the foundation for all the food chains and for biodiversity on the ground. Healthy soils are a solution for the key challenges addressed by the European Green Deal, including climate neutrality, a clean and circular economy, reversing biodiversity loss, providing healthy food, safeguarding human health, halting desertification and land degradation. Yet, around 60 to 70% of soils in the EU are not healthy. Every year about 1 billion tons of soil are washed away by erosion in the EU, causing an estimated loss of agricultural production in the EU of \\u20ac1.25 billion per year. Soils suffer also from organic matter decline, pollution, loss of biodiversity, salinisation and sealing resulting from unsustainable land-use and management, overexploitation and emissions of pollutants. We can no longer neglect the risk that comes from the worsening situation of European soils. We need a transformation where protecting, sustainably managing and restoring soils is part of the socio-economic model. The Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 announced a new Soil Strategy to make European soils healthy again and strive to achieve land degradation neutrality by 2030, one of the Sustainable Development Goals the EU subscribed to.\", \"How serious is the problem of soil degradation?\": \"Every year, about 1 billion tonnes of soil are washed away by erosion, the equivalent of one metre depth on an area corresponding to the surface of Berlin. Carbon stocks in soils are declining: between 45.000 and 55.000 km2 of peatlands have been drained in the past for agricultural use and are emitting carbon into the atmosphere. 2.8 million sites are potentially polluted by industrial risk activities. More than 400 km2 of land is taken every year on a net basis by urban areas and infrastructure, predominantly at the expense of agricultural land. Intensive land management and land use change negatively impacts soil biodiversity such as earthworms, springtails and mites. Human induced salinization affects 3.8 million ha in the EU, with severe soil salinity along the coastlines, particularly in the Mediterranean. In Southern, Central and Eastern Europe 25% of soils show high or very high risk of desertification corresponding to about 411 000 km2.\", \"What are the main actions to address soil pollution?\": \"The Soil Strategy builds on the actions already proposed in the Chemicals Strategy and the Zero Pollution Action Plan. In line with the zero pollution ambition, soil pollution should be reduced by 2050 to levels that are not harmful for people and environment. To prevent soil pollution, the Commission will revise the Sustainable Use of Pesticides Directive and evaluate the Sewage Sludge Directive, restrict substances such as microplastics and PFAS under the REACH Regulation, improve risk assessment methodologies and review the application of the Fertilising Products Regulation. The Commission will consider options for proposing legally binding provisions to identify, register and remediate contaminated sites. In addition, the Commission will develop an EU priority list for soil contaminants, revise the Industrial Emissions Directive, evaluate the Environmental Liability Directive and assess the feasibility of introducing a soil health certificate for land transactions.\", \"Will the Commission propose legislation on soil?\": \"Soils deserve and require the same level of legal protection as air, water and the marine environment at EU level. The Commission will now work very closely with Member States, experts and stakeholders and, following the vision set out in this Strategy, carry out an impact assessment. In consequence, the Commission will propose a new legislative initiative on soil health to meet the objectives of the Soil Strategy. Such proposal will tackle the transboundary impact of soil degradation and set measures across the EU, building on the sustainability principle and applying the better regulation rules. While many problems will require a common European approach, the Commission will undertake a diligent subsidiarity check. Apart from getting the scope and the level of ambition right, this check will also ensure that national and regional solutions can be applied where they make more sense. The European Parliament has already called for such an EU-wide common legal framework for soil. The Committee of the Regions, the European Court of Auditors as well as numerous stakeholders have echoed this request.\", \"How will soil protection help against climate change?\": \"Healthy soils will strengthen the EU's resilience and reduce its vulnerability to climate change. Soils are the largest terrestrial carbon pool on the planet. They store more carbon than the atmosphere and all biomass combined. Given the crucial role of soil in the water cycle, it is also an indispensable ally for climate adaptation. A high water retention capacity in soils reduces the effects of floods and decreases the negative impact of droughts. To achieve a climate-neutral Europe by 2050, and land-based neutrality by 2035, it is crucial to stop emissions from drained peatlands and to increase the carbon that is stored in other soils. Restoring peatlands alone could significantly reduce CO2 emissions, which comes with numerous additional benefits including for nature, biodiversity and water protection. The Commission will launch a carbon farming initiative and join the global \\u201c4 per 1000\\u201d initiative to increase the soil organic carbon content in agricultural land. Supported by solid science, this initiative invites all partners to state or implement practical actions on soil carbon storage and the type of practices to achieve this (e.g. agroecology, agroforestry, conservation agriculture, landscape management, etc.). The ambition of the initiative is to encourage stakeholders to transition towards a productive, highly resilient agriculture, based on the appropriate management of lands and soils. To make sustainable soil management the new normal, a set of practices and principles will be established and a network of practitioners, living labs and lighthouses will promote these. By 2023, the Commission will propose a legislative framework for an EU sustainable food system.\", \"What actions are planned to boost soil's contribution to the circular economy?\": \"The safe application of clean compost, digestate, sewage sludge and processed manure will help to close the nutrient and carbon cycles. Prioritising the circular use of land over greenfield development will limit the acute pressure from soil sealing and land take on forests, agricultural land and nature. To safely re-use excavated soils and to separate contaminated from clean soil, it is necessary to enhance monitoring throughout the value chain, with traceability and quality control from the excavation site up to the receiving end. The Commission will further investigate the streams of excavated soils generated, treated and re-used in the EU, and benchmark the market situation in Member States by 2023. The Commission will also assess the need and potential for legally binding provisions for a \\u201cpassport for excavated soil\\u201d as part of the development of the Soil Health Law, and provide guidance, based on Member States experiences, to put in place such a system. To achieve the EU goal of no net land take by 2050, Member States should set by 2023 their own ambitious national, regional and local net land take reduction targets for 2030 and apply the \\u2018land take hierarchy' of avoid \\u2013 reuse \\u2013 minimize \\u2013 compensate, instead of sealing off new natural or agricultural land. The Commission will, as part of the impact assessment on the Soil Health Law, consider options to monitor and report on the progress towards the no net land take targets and provide guidance to public authorities and private companies on how to reduce soil sealing.\", \"What does \\u2018land take' and \\u2018no net land take' mean?\": \"The Soil Health Law will provide the definition, following an impact assessment and a consultation with Member States, experts and stakeholders. Scientific literature defines land take generally as the loss of agricultural, forest and other semi-natural and natural land to urban and other artificial land development. This includes areas sealed by construction and urban infrastructure as well as urban green areas and sport and leisure facilities. Since the 1950s it has largely been driven by urban sprawl. Sealing agricultural land and open spaces should be avoided as far as possible and the focus should be on building on land that has already been sealed. This might require greater investment, for example to redevelop land previously used as an industrial site (including decontamination). When land is taken, the aspiration is to ensure this is no more than is compensated for elsewhere - \\u2018no net land take'. For example, unused land could be returned to cultivation or renaturalised so that it can once again provide the ecosystem services of unsealed soils.\", \"How does the Strategy address desertification?\": \"Desertification is a form of land degradation in drylands. It is a growing threat in the EU, exacerbated by climate change. Its effects will be particularly acute in Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece, Cyprus, Bulgaria and Romania. The Soil Strategy addresses the recommendations made by the European Court of Auditors in its report on desertification.  The Commission will establish a methodology to map and assess desertification and land degradation in the EU, and regularly report on the trend. The Commission also proposes to declare the EU as party affected by desertification under the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), and continue to encourage Member States to participate in its Land Degradation Neutrality Target Setting Programme.\", \"What does the Strategy mean for farmers?\": \"Farmers work on their land every day. Their livelihood and our future depends on the long-term health of the soils on which they grow their crops or graze their livestock. The Commission will assist Member States to set up a \\u201ctest your soil for free\\u201d initiative, allowing farmers and other actors to know more about the health of their soil. Through new carbon farming models and private sustainable investment schemes, farmers will be rewarded for storing carbon and delivering ecosystem services. Working towards a state of no net land take and applying a hierarchy to increase circular use of land will help to secure sufficient land for food production also in the future. The Common Agricultural Policy is an indispensable tool to support farmers in embracing soil stewardship. The Common Agricultural Policy as well as the farm advisory services will have a key role to play in supporting the greater use of sustainable soil management practices amongst farmers. Farmers will also be closely involved and will benefit from investments in knowledge exchange and development. With the involvement of the agricultural sector, the Horizon Europe Mission \\u2018A Soil Deal for Europe' will set-up 100 living labs and lighthouses to foster the transition to sustainable soil management in agricultural land.\", \"What are the costs and benefits of the Strategy?\": \"The impact of land and soil degradation is enormous, and comes with a huge cost of \\u20ac50 billion per year for the EU. Soil erosion costs Europe \\u20ac1.25 billion solely in annual agricultural productivity loss. Soil degradation affects us all economically: 54% of the cost represents a loss of ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, hydrological control, nutrient cycling, hosting soil biodiversity and provision of recreation. The other half of the cost often comes at the expense of private parties and landowners due to a reduction in provisioning services such as biomass and raw materials. The cost of taking action is much smaller than the cost of inaction. Halting and reversing current trends of soil degradation could generate up to \\u20ac1.2 trillion per year of economic benefits globally. Investing in soil prevention and restoration makes sound economic sense, as healthy soils are our best insurance to secure our well-being in the long-run.\", \"What funding opportunities are available at EU level?\": \"The EU provides a lot of funding to projects and initiatives that make soils healthier: The LIFE programme contributes to the development and demonstration of innovative solutions for the improvement of soil quality.The Common Agricultural Policy supports the sustainable development of rural areas through improving the competitiveness of agriculture and forestry, by ensuring sustainable soil management and by territorial development of rural economies.The European Regional Development Fund and Cohesion Fund strengthen economic, social and territorial cohesion by supporting the transition to a greener and carbon free Europe. This includes the protection of nature, biodiversity and green infrastructure including in cities, and the rehabilitation of contaminated land.The Just Transition Fund enables regions and people to address the social, economic and environmental impacts of the transition towards a climate-neutral economy. Investments in regeneration and decontamination of sites, land restoration and repurposing projects are eligible when these help to achieve climate neutrality, e.g. the remediation of former coal mines that are put out of commission.The Recovery and Resilience Facility makes loans and grants available to support Member States with the green transition. A number of national Recovery and Resilience Plans have included measures on soil protection. Particularly relevant in this context is the Commission's \\u2018do no significant harm' technical guidance to help Member States prepare their Recovery and Resilience Plans.The Horizon Europe programme supports knowledge development for the cluster food, bioeconomy, natural resources, agriculture and environment. The programme also launched a Mission \\u2018A Soil Deal for Europe'. Horizon Europe also co-funds several relevant EU partnerships, amongst others the partnership for the assessment of the risks of chemicals, the partnership on agro-ecology living labs and research infrastructures.\", \"How will the EU work with its international partners to protect soils worldwide?\": \"Healthy soils are crucial to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and land degradation neutrality (SDG 15.3). The Commission will join the global \\u201c4 per 1000\\u201d initiative, propose to declare the EU as affected party under the UNCCD and continue to support the Global Soil Partnership and other international projects in promoting sustainable soil management worldwide. The EU will aim for increased ambition under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and a post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework that recognizes the importance of soil biodiversity and sustainable soil management. The Commission will also support the establishment of the Global Soil Biodiversity Observatory as proposed by FAO's Global Soil Partnership.\", \"How does the Strategy aim to increase knowledge on soils?\": \"The Commission will enhance the use of digital tools and rely on the European Environment Agency (EEA) to further develop the Land Information System for Europe (LISE), based on the Copernicus Land Monitoring Portal. The promotion of scientific knowledge and data collection about soil will be substantially boosted through specific initiatives, such as the Horizon Europe Mission \\u2018A Soil Deal for Europe', the EU Soil Observatory, the Land Use/Cover Area framework Survey (LUCAS) and Digital Earth. The Commission will also launch soil literacy and awareness initiatives, and make sure that sufficient private and public funding is made available to finance the transition.\"}}"
